In TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript, there isn't a dedicated `Math.max()` function in a separate Math library as in Java. However, JavaScript (and thus TypeScript) has a global `Math` object that provides various mathematical functions and constants, similar to Java's `Math` class.

The `Math.max()` function in TypeScript/JavaScript works quite similarly to Java's `Math.max()` method. It returns the largest of the zero or more numbers given as input parameters.

Here are some frequently used math functions available in TypeScript/JavaScript, similar to those in Java's `Math` class:

1. **Math.max(...values)**: Returns the largest of zero or more numbers.
2. **Math.min(...values)**: Returns the smallest of zero or more numbers.
3. **Math.round(value)**: Rounds a number to the nearest integer.
4. **Math.ceil(value)**: Rounds a number upward to its nearest integer.
5. **Math.floor(value)**: Rounds a number downward to its nearest integer.
6. **Math.abs(value)**: Returns the absolute value of a number.
7. **Math.sqrt(value)**: Returns the square root of a number.
8. **Math.pow(base, exponent)**: Returns the base to the exponent power, that is, base^exponent.
9. **Math.random()**: Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.
10. **Math.sin(value)**, **Math.cos(value)**, **Math.tan(value)**: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
11. **Math.log(value)**: Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of a number.

These functions are part of the ECMAScript standard and are available in any environment that supports JavaScript, including browsers and Node.js environments. They are accessed through the `Math` object, e.g., `Math.max(1, 2, 3)`.
