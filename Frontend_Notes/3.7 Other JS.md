# JavaScript's Strict Mode Features

JavaScript's Strict Mode is a feature that enforces a stricter parsing and error handling mechanism on your JavaScript code. Activating Strict Mode can be done by adding `'use strict';` at the beginning of a script or a function block. This mode intentionally has different semantics from the normal code, aimed at improving code reliability and performance.

## Features of Strict Mode

1. **Mandatory Variable Declarations**: In Strict Mode, every variable must be declared before use. If a script attempts to use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will throw a `ReferenceError`. This requirement helps to avoid the accidental creation of global variables caused by typographical errors.

2. **Disallows the `with` Statement**: The `with` statement is not allowed in Strict Mode because it creates ambiguity about the scope of variables. Its use can lead to significant performance hits and complicates the debugging process, as it modifies the scope chain, making it harder to predict which variables will be affected by a piece of code.

3. **Scoped `eval()` Function**: Any declarations within an `eval()` expression in Strict Mode do not affect the surrounding scope, making `eval()` safer by preventing it from introducing new variables or modifying existing ones in the parent scope.

4. **Secure `this` Keyword Behavior**: In functions that are not called as methods of an object, the value of `this` is `undefined` in Strict Mode. This contrasts with non-strict mode, where `this` defaults to the global object, reducing the risk of inadvertently modifying the global environment.

5. **Prohibits Duplicate Parameter Names**: Functions cannot have multiple parameters with the same name, which eliminates potential errors from duplicated identifiers and enhances code clarity.

6. **Immutable Non-Writable Properties**: In Strict Mode, attempts to assign values to non-writable properties result in a `TypeError`. This feature ensures the immutability of constants and read-only properties, thus preserving data integrity.

7. **Restrictions on Deleting Properties**: Trying to delete non-deletable properties (such as built-in objects or fixed properties) will throw a `TypeError`, protecting important parts of the languageâ€™s core.

8. **No Octal Numeric Literals**: Octal literals and octal escape sequences are not allowed in Strict Mode. This restriction avoids confusion between mistakenly leading zeroes in numbers and octal syntax, making the code more readable and less prone to errors. 
   - Octal literals are those starting with a leading zero, like `010` stands for 8 in decimal. Octal escape sequences are those starting with `\`, like `\141` stands for `'a'`. We can use `u0061` instead of `\141` to represent `'a'`, and `0o10` instead of `010` to represent `8`.

# Why 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3
This is a result of how computers handle binary floating-point arithmetic.

When you add these approximations, the tiny errors in their representation lead to results that are not exact, hence 0.1 + 0.2 results in something slightly different from 0.3. 

In practical terms, to compare floating-point numbers in such cases, a common approach is to check if they are close enough to each other, within a small tolerance, rather than expecting exact equality.

```javascript
const tolerance = 0.0001;
const sum = 0.1 + 0.2;
const target = 0.3;

if (Math.abs(sum - target) < tolerance) {
    console.log('Equal');
} else {
    console.log('Not Equal');
}
```
