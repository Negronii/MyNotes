# Differences Between offsetHeight, scrollHeight, and clientHeight

1. **offsetHeight**: The `offsetHeight` property measures the total visible height of an element, including padding, border, and the scroll bar on the element (if any), but excluding margins. It's the outermost height measurement that includes everything inside the margin.

2. **clientHeight**: The `clientHeight` property measures the visible content area (including padding) of an element but excludes the border, scrollbar, and margin. It's useful for getting the actual area available for the content inside an element.

3. **scrollHeight**: The `scrollHeight` property measures the total height of an element's content, including content not visible on the screen due to overflow. It includes padding but excludes borders, scrollbar, and margin. This is larger than the `clientHeight` if there's content that overflows outside the visible area.
