### Garbage Collection in JavaScript

Garbage collection in JavaScript is an automated process that identifies and frees up memory that is no longer being used by the application. This process is vital for preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory usage. JavaScript implements garbage collection primarily through the following methods:

1. **Reference Counting**: In this method, the garbage collector counts the number of references to a value. When the reference count drops to zero, indicating that no part of the program is using that value, it is considered garbage and eligible for collection. However, reference counting has a significant limitation with circular references, where two objects reference each other, leading to memory leaks as their reference count never reaches zero.

2. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**: Modern JavaScript engines, such as V8 (Chrome, Node.js) and SpiderMonkey (Firefox), use the Mark-and-Sweep algorithm. This method involves marking "roots" (variables directly referenced by the code being run, plus global variables). The garbage collector then traverses from these roots and marks all reachable objects. Objects not marked as reachable are considered unreachable and eligible for garbage collection. This approach effectively resolves the issue of circular references found in reference counting.

### Closures and Memory Leaks in JavaScript

Closures in JavaScript are not inherent sources of memory leaks. They are essential features that allow functions to access and remember variables from their lexical scope, even after the outer function has executed. However, if closures retain references to extensive scopes or objects longer than needed, they can contribute to memory leaks. This typically occurs when a closure, no longer in use, is still referenced in the code, preventing the garbage collector from freeing the memory of the scope's variables. Developers can prevent such issues by carefully managing the lifecycle of closures and ensuring they are dereferenced when no longer needed. This is particularly important in scenarios with loops or large objects.

### Detecting Memory Leaks in JavaScript and React

To detect memory leaks in JavaScript and React, tools like the Chrome Developer Tools are invaluable. The Performance tab in these tools allows developers to record memory usage while interacting with the application. Observing the heap usage over time helps identify potential memory leaks, indicated by a continuous increase in memory usage without drops after garbage collection cycles. 

Common scenarios leading to memory leaks in React include:
- Unmanaged event listeners
- Uncleared timers
- Misuse of external libraries
- Improper handling of state and props

Preventing memory leaks involves proactive resource management, such as removing event listeners and clearing timers when components unmount.
