# Main Components of a Web Browser
- **User Interface (UI)**  
The user interface includes elements like the address bar, navigation buttons (back, forward), and bookmarking menu, which facilitate user interaction with the browser.

- **Browser Engine**  
The browser engine acts as a mediator between the UI and the rendering engine, managing inputs and outputs from the user interface to the display.

- **Rendering Engine**  
The rendering engine interprets HTML, CSS, and images from the web, rendering them as visual outputs on the screen.

- **Networking**  
This component handles network operations such as HTTP requests. It is vital for fetching resources like HTML pages, images, and other files required for web content rendering.

- **JavaScript Interpreter**  
The JavaScript interpreter parses and executes JavaScript code, enabling dynamic interactions within web pages through scripting.

- **UI Backend**  
The UI backend is responsible for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows, serving as a bridge between the operating system and the graphical rendering.

- **Data Storage**  
Data storage mechanisms in browsers manage the storage of data such as cookies, cache, and local storage, playing a crucial role in data persistence and retrieval.

# Describe the Complete Process of Entering a URL to Presenting the Page

## Web Request
1. **DNS Lookup**: The browser initiates a DNS query to convert the hostname in the URL into an IP address. This process may involve querying multiple DNS servers.
2. **TCP Connection**: Establishes a TCP connection with the server using a **three-way handshake**. This ensures a reliable communication channel.
3. **HTTP Request**: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address, requesting the webpage content.
4. **Server Response**: The server processes the request and sends back a response, typically including the HTML source code of the page.

## Parsing HTML
1. **Resource Fetching**: As the browser parses the HTML, it may encounter references to external resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and videos. Each of these resources may require additional DNS lookups, TCP connections, and HTTP requests.
2. **DOM and CSSOM Trees**: The browser converts the HTML document into a structured format known as the Document Object Model (DOM). Simultaneously, CSS files are processed into the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) or style tree.
3. **Render Tree Construction**: The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the render tree, which represents all visible elements on the page and their styles.
4. **Optimization**: To optimize loading and parsing:
   - CSS is typically placed in the `<head>` to avoid rendering blocks.
   - JavaScript files are placed at the end of the `<body>` or loaded with `defer` or `async` attributes to not block HTML parsing.
   - Specifying image dimensions helps in layout calculation and prevents reflows.

## Rendering the Page
1. **Layout Calculation**: The browser calculates the size and position of each element in the render tree.
2. **Painting**: The visible elements are then painted onto the screen.
3. **JavaScript Execution**: JavaScript files are executed, which may modify the DOM and trigger a re-rendering of the page.
4. **Asynchronous Loading**: Some resources, like CSS and images, are fetched asynchronously and may cause the page to render again upon loading.
