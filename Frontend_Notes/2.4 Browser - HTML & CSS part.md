# Web Performance: Repaint vs. Reflow
## Reflow
Reflow, also known as layout, involves recalculating the positions and dimensions of elements to accurately reflect any changes in the DOM that affect their layout. This calculation is necessary to construct the render tree, which integrates style information with visible elements.

Reflow is computationally intensive as it may affect the layout of the entire page, not just the element being altered. Common triggers include:
- Resizing the browser window.
- Modifying content that affects layout (e.g., adding or removing elements).
- Alterations in style properties (e.g., width, height, margin, padding).

## Repaint
Repaint deals with redrawing the visual styles of elements without affecting their layout. After the layout is determined and the render tree constructed, repaint updates the visual appearance based on style changes.

Repaint is less performance-heavy as it does not involve layout changes. Typical scenarios include:
- Changes in visibility, colors, or shadows.
- Adjustments to backgrounds or borders.

## Comparing Reflow and Repaint
Reflow will trigger a repaint, but a repaint does not necessarily cause a reflow.

### **Performance Costs**
The primary distinction lies in their impact on performance:
- **Reflows** can affect the entire page and are therefore more costly.
- **Repaints** affect only the appearance, without layout changes, making them less resource-intensive.

## Optimization Strategies
To minimize performance costs, implement the following practices:

- **Batch Style Changes**  
Group multiple style changes into a single class adjustment to reduce the number of reflows.

- **Minimize DOM Access**  
Modify elements offscreen or within a document fragment to limit the impact on the actual DOM.

- **Leverage Block Formatting Context**  
Using BFC properties can prevent elements from affecting each otherâ€™s layout, thus reducing reflows.

- **Optimize Event Handling**  
Implement debouncing or throttling to manage events that cause frequent reflows, such as resizing or scrolling.

- **Prioritize CSS3 and `requestAnimationFrame`**  
For animations, prefer CSS3 and `requestAnimationFrame` over JavaScript-driven animations to decrease both reflow and repaint occurrences.

# `<script>` Element

The `<script>` element in HTML is used to embed or reference executable JavaScript code within an HTML document. 

## Basic Usage of `<script>`

1. **Embedding JavaScript:**
   ```html
   <script>
     // JavaScript code here
   </script>
   ```

2. **Referencing an External Script:**
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
   ```

## `defer` and `async` Attributes

Both `defer` and `async` attributes are used to control how scripts are loaded and executed, especially for scripts that are referenced from external files.

1. **`defer` Attribute:**

   - The `defer` attribute ensures that the script is executed only after the HTML document has been completely parsed.
   - Scripts with the `defer` attribute are executed in the order they appear in the document.

2. **`async` Attribute:**

   - The `async` attribute allows the script to be executed asynchronously as soon as it is available.
   - Scripts with the `async` attribute are executed as soon as they are downloaded, without waiting for the HTML parsing to complete.
   - The execution order is not guaranteed; scripts may execute in any order.

## When to Use `async` and `defer`

1. **`async`:**
   - Use `async` for scripts that are independent and do not rely on other scripts or the HTML structure.
   - Ideal for analytics scripts, ads, or any script that does not need to manipulate the DOM immediately.

2. **`defer`:**
   - Use `defer` for scripts that need to manipulate the DOM or depend on other scripts.
   - Suitable for scripts that need to maintain order and interact with the document content.

## Best Practices for `<script>` Element

1. **Store JavaScript in External Files:**
   For readability and maintainability, store JavaScript in external files rather than embedding it directly within HTML.
2. **Place `<script>` tags just before the closing `</body>` tag:**
   Ensure the HTML is fully loaded before any script runs.
3. **Minimize and Compress Scripts:**
   - Reduce size and improve load times. Use tools like UglifyJS, Terser.
1. **Use Non-Blocking JavaScript:**
   - Avoid blocking the rendering of the page by using `defer` or `async`.
   - Ensuring that the static content loads first.
