# CSS Units: Differences and Usage

1. **Pixels (px):** Pixels are a fixed-size unit that is most commonly used in screen media. A pixel is an absolute unit that doesn't change based on other elements. It's great for when you need precise control over element sizing, like for borders or shadows.

2. **Percent (%):** Percentages are relative units and depend on the parent element's size. They are extremely useful for creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, maintaining proportions regardless of the parent size.

3. **Ems (em):** Ems are relative to the font-size of the element they are used on. If used on font-size, they are relative to the font-size of the parent element. Ems are great for scalable typography and elements that need to maintain their proportions relative to text size.

4. **Rems (rem):** Rems are relative to the font-size of the root element (html). They allow for consistent scaling across the entire document and are very useful in responsive design for maintaining uniformity in spacing, layout, and typography.

5. **Viewport Width (vw):** 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport's width. This unit is helpful for creating elements that scale with the width of the viewport, like for fluid layouts and typography.

6. **Viewport Height (vh):** Similarly, 1vh is 1% of the viewport's height. It's useful for elements that should scale with the height of the viewport, such as sections of a single-page layout.

7. **Viewport Minimum (vmin):** This unit is 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width). Vmin is particularly useful for maintaining aspect ratios in responsive design.

8. **Viewport Maximum (vmax):** Conversely, vmax is 1% of the larger dimension (height or width). It's less commonly used but can be beneficial for certain design challenges.

## Example of Responsive Design Code
```css
/* Base HTML font size */
html {
    font-size: 16px; /* Set a standard font size */
}

/* Responsive font size for smaller screens */
@media only screen and (max-width: 300px) {
    html {
        font-size: 14px; /* Reduce font size on small devices */
    }
}

/* Paragraph styling */
p {
    font-size: 1rem; /* Font size is relative to HTML element */
    line-height: 1.5; /* Good for readability */
    margin: 0 0 1rem 0; /* Spacing for paragraphs */
}

/* Responsive element styling */
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    p {
        font-size: 0.9rem; /* Smaller font size on tablets and smaller devices */
    }
}
```

# CSS Selectors and Their Priorities
CSS selectors are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style. These selectors target specific elements based on their attributes, position within the HTML document, and their relationship to other elements.

## Types of CSS Selectors
- **Element Selectors**: Target elements based on their type, e.g., `p`, `div`, `h1`.
- **Class Selectors**: Target elements using their class attribute, prefixed with a dot, e.g., `.className`.
- **ID Selectors**: Target elements using their ID attribute, prefixed with a hash, e.g., `#idName`.
- **Attribute Selectors**: Select elements based on an attribute or attribute value, e.g., `[type="text"]`.
- **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: 
  - Pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:focus` target elements in specific states.
  - Pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` target specific parts of an element.
- **Combinators**: Include child (`>`), descendant (` `), adjacent sibling (`+`), and general sibling (`~`) selectors.

## Selector Specificity and Priorities
- **Specificity Rules**: Specificity determines which CSS rule applies if one element is targeted by multiple rules. The specificity hierarchy from highest to lowest priority is:
  - Inline styles, found within HTML tags.
  - ID selectors.
  - Class, pseudo-class, and attribute selectors.
  - Element selectors.
  - Universal selector (`*`), combinators, and negation pseudo-class (`:not()`), which do not contribute to specificity.
- **Important Note**: The `!important` declaration overrides other declarations but should be used sparingly to avoid complications in debugging.
- **Calculating Specificity**: Specificity is calculated as a numerical value, where:
  - ID selectors contribute the most to specificity.
  - Class, pseudo-classes, and attributes contribute less than IDs but more than elements.

**Examples**
- Example 1: `#header` will override `.main .header` due to higher specificity of the ID selector.
- Example 2: `h1.title` is more specific than `h1` because it combines an element and a class selector.

## Best Practices for Using CSS Selectors
- Maintain simplicity and reusability in selectors to facilitate easier management and maintenance of style sheets.
- Avoid overly specific selectors to ensure CSS remains flexible and manageable.
- Use meaningful class and ID names that reflect the function or content rather than appearance.


# CSS Display Properties
## Block Boxes
- **Description**: Block boxes consume the full width available in their parent container, creating a new line before and after the box. This behavior is typical for structural elements used to group content sections.
- **Examples**: `div`, `section`, `p`, `header`, `footer`, `h1` to `h6`
- **Properties**: The `width` and `height` properties are applicable.
- **CSS Syntax**: `display: block;`

## Inline Boxes
- **Description**: Inline boxes do not break the line. They flow within the text and other inline elements, suitable for styling portions of text without disrupting the document flow.
- **Examples**: `span`, `a`, `em`, `strong`
- **Properties**: The `width` and `height` properties do not affect inline elements as their dimensions are content-driven.
- **CSS Syntax**: `display: inline;`

## Inline-Block Boxes
- **Description**: Inline-block boxes combine features of both block and inline boxes. They allow elements to sit next to each other on the same line while still maintaining block properties like width and height.
- **Examples**: Useful for creating menus or button groups where elements need to be aligned horizontally but also require specific dimensions.
- **CSS Syntax**: `display: inline-block;`

# Inheritance in CSS

CSS inheritance works by allowing certain properties of a parent element to influence the same properties in its child elements, unless these properties are explicitly overridden. This means that if a style is defined for a parent element, the child elements will automatically adopt this style, following the "cascading" nature of CSS.

#### Properties That Inherit by Default

- **Font Styles**: 
  - `font-family`: Defines the typeface.
  - `font-size`: Specifies the size of the font.
  - `font-style`: Determines whether the text is italicized.
  - `font-weight`: Controls the thickness of the font.
  - `line-height`: Sets the space between lines of text.

- **Text Formatting**:
  - `text-align`: Aligns text within an element (e.g., left, right, center).
  - `text-indent`: Indents the first line of a text block.
  - `text-transform`: Controls capitalization (e.g., uppercase, lowercase).
  - `text-decoration`: Applies decoration to text (e.g., underline, line-through).
  - `text-shadow`: Adds shadow to text.

- **Spacing**:
  - `letter-spacing`: Adjusts the space between characters.
  - `word-spacing`: Modifies the space between words.

- **Visibility**:
  - `visibility`: Specifies whether an element is visible or hidden.

# How to handle text Overflow with Ellipsis (`...`) in CSS? 
## For Single-line Text Overflow
```css
.box1 {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  width: 100px; /* Fixed width */
  white-space: nowrap; /* Prevents text from wrapping to a new line */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hides text that overflows the container's bounds */
  text-overflow: ellipsis; /* Adds an ellipsis to indicate text overflow */
}
```

In this setup, `white-space: nowrap` ensures the text stays on a single line, `overflow: hidden` hides any overflow, and `text-overflow: ellipsis` replaces the hidden overflow text with an ellipsis.

## For Multi-line Text Overflow
```css
.box2 {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  width: 100px; /* Fixed width */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hides text that overflows the container's bounds */
  display: -webkit-box; /* Displays the container as a webkit flex box */
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical; /* Sets the children's orientation to vertical */
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3; /* Limits the box to showing 3 lines of text, with overflow indicated by an ellipsis */
}
```

This method uses `-webkit-box`, `-webkit-box-orient`, and `-webkit-line-clamp` to achieve multi-line truncation. It's important to note that this approach is somewhat limited by its compatibility with only webkit-based browsers (e.g., Safari, Chrome). However, it's widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in most web scenarios.
