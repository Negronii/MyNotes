### Array Flattening Function in JavaScript

**Recursive Approach**
```ts
function arrayFlatten(arr: any[]): any[] {
    let flattenedArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (Array.isArray(arr[i])) {
            flattenedArray = flattenedArray.concat(arrayFlatten(arr[i]));
        } else {
            flattenedArray.push(arr[i]);
        }
    }
    return flattenedArray;
}
```
**Advantages**:
- Works universally, including in environments without ES6 support.
- Easy to understand and implement.

**Disadvantages**:
- Can be less efficient with very deep or very large arrays due to recursive calls.

**Functional Programming Approach**
```ts
function arrayFlatten(arr: any[]): any[]{
    return arr.reduce((prev, cur) => {
        return prev.concat(Array.isArray(cur) ? arrayFlatten(cur) : cur);
    }, []);
}
```
**Advantages**:
- Declarative and concise.
- Leverages functional programming techniques.

**Disadvantages**:
- Recursive, similar performance considerations as the recursive approach.

**Iterative Approach**
```ts
function arrayFlatten(arr: any[]): any[] {
    while (arr.some(Array.isArray)) {
        arr = [].concat(...arr);
    }
    return arr;
}
```
**Advantages**:
- Non-recursive, potentially better performance on large datasets.
- Easy to read and understand.

**Disadvantages**:
- Might not be as intuitive for those unfamiliar with JavaScript's spread operator and `some` method.

**ES6 Flat Method**
```ts
function arrayFlatten(arr: any[]): any[] {
    return arr.flat(Infinity);
}
```
**Advantages**:
- Simplest and most elegant solution.
- Very efficient and concise.

**Disadvantages**:
- Limited browser support; not available in Internet Explorer or older browsers.

### JavaScript Promises

#### Definition and Basic Example
A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It serves as a link between the executing code and the resulting success outcome or failure reason. Here's a simple example to illustrate its use:

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Success!');
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then(value => {
  console.log(value); // Outputs: Success!
});
```

#### States of a Promise
**Promise** objects can exist in one of three states:
- **Pending:** The initial state of a promise. The outcome is not yet known.
- **Fulfilled:** Indicates that the asynchronous operation completed successfully.
- **Rejected:** Indicates that the asynchronous operation failed.

#### Prototype Methods
##### Promise.prototype.then()
This method is used for chaining multiple operations that should occur after the Promise settles. It accepts two callback functions: one for success (`resolve`) and one for failure (`reject`). Here's how chaining works:

```javascript
promise.then(result => {
  return result + ' and more!';
}).then(newResult => {
  console.log(newResult); // Outputs: Success! and more!
});
```

##### Promise.prototype.catch()
Used for error handling, this method is a shorthand for `.then(undefined, rejectionHandler)`. It captures any errors that occur during the promise execution chain.

##### Promise.prototype.finally()
This method executes a final piece of code after the Promise is settled, regardless of its outcome, useful for cleaning up resources or logging:

```javascript
promise.finally(() => {
  console.log('Promise was settled.');
});
```

#### Promise Static Methods
##### Promise.all()
Allows for the handling of multiple promises concurrently. It returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved, or rejects if any input promise rejects:

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then(values => {
  console.log(values); // Outputs: [3, 42, 'foo']
});
```

##### Promise.race()
Returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable resolves or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise:

```javascript
const promiseOne = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
});
const promiseTwo = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(reject, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then(value => {
  console.log(value);
}).catch(reason => {
  console.log(reason); // Outputs: two
});
```

##### Promise.resolve() and Promise.reject()
- **Promise.resolve(value)** returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.
- **Promise.reject(reason)** returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.

### Understanding Promise Execution Order
#### Basic Promise Execution Flow
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(0);
  return Promise.resolve(4);
}).then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(1);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(2);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(3);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(5);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(6);
});
```

**Expected Output:** `0 1 2 3 4 5 6`.

**Key Points:**   
- Promises that are resolved invoke their `.then()` callbacks in a sequence.
- The JavaScript event loop facilitates a balanced execution flow across various promise chains, preventing any single promise from monopolizing the event loop's attention.
- When a `.then()` callback generates a new promise, it introduces an additional task in the microtask queue. This ensures that the new promise's resolution is queued following the microtask queue's principles, allowing the ongoing execution to proceed uninterrupted.

#### Interleaved Execution with Multiple Promises
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(0);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(1);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(2);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(3);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(4);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(5);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(6);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(7);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(8);
});
```

**Expected Output:** `0 3 6 1 4 7 2 5 8`.

**Explanation:**  
- This example illustrates how the execution of `.then()` callbacks from multiple promises can be interleaved. This approach ensures that asynchronous tasks initiated around the same time advance in a balanced manner.

#### Delayed Execution with Nested Promises
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(0);
  return Promise.resolve(1);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(2);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(3);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(4);
  return Promise.resolve(5);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(6);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(7);
});
```
**Output:** `0 4 2 6 3 7`.

**Detailed Insights:**  
- When a `.then()` callback returns another promise, it delays the execution order. This delay is twofold: one for the promise to settle and another for its resolution to be queued in the microtask queue.
- This highlights the role of the event loop and microtask queue in managing the execution order of asynchronous operations in JavaScript, demonstrating the intricacies of asynchronous execution timing.

#### Simulating Promise Execution Order
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  // First beat
  const p = Promise.resolve(1);
  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    // Second beat
    p.then(res => {
      console.log(res);
    }).then(() => {
      console.log(2);
    });
  });
});
```

This simulation illustrates the complexity of managing asynchronous operations with promises. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the scheduling mechanisms of promises and their resolutions by the JavaScript event loop and microtask queue to effectively control asynchronous code flow.

### What is and when to use `for await...of`
The for await...of statement is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to loop over asynchronous iterablesâ€”objects that you can iterate over asynchronously, such as Promises. It waits until the Promise is resolved before moving to the next iteration, making it useful for handling asynchronous operations in a sequential manner.
```ts
async function processPromises() {
    function createPromise(val) {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve(val);
            }, 1000);
        });
    }

    const p1 = createPromise(100);
    const p2 = createPromise(200);
    const p3 = createPromise(300);
    const list = [p1, p2, p3];

    // Iterating over an array of Promises and logging each resolved value
    // effect is same as:
    // Promise.all(list).then(res => console.log(res))
    for await (let res of list) {
        console.log(res);
    }

    // Performing asynchronous operations in sequence
    const arr = [100, 200, 300];
    for (let num of arr) {
        const res = await createPromise(num); // Ensure this code is inside an async function
        console.log(res);
    }
}

processPromises();
```

The `for await...of` loop is a powerful feature for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, providing a more intuitive and cleaner way to process sequences of Promises compared to chaining or using `Promise.all()`. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain the order of operations or when working with streams of asynchronous data.

`Promise.all()` only make sure the promises are resolved in parallel, or there is an error in any of the promises, but `for await...of` makes sure the promises are resolved in sequence.

### Write a `curry` function to curry other functions
Currying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions that each take a single argument. Its main benefits include **parameter reuse, delayed execution, early return, and function composition**.

```ts
function curry(fn: Function) {
    return function curried(...args: any[]) {
        if (args.length >= fn.length) {
            return fn.apply(this, args);
        } else {
            return function (...nextArgs: any[]) {
                return curried.apply(this, args.concat(nextArgs));
            };
        }
    };
}

function sum(a: number, b: number, c: number) {
    return a + b + c;
}

const curriedSum = curry(sum);
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6
console.log(curriedSum(1, 2)(3)); // Output: 6
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

### Implement `LazyMan` Class

The `LazyMan` class simulates a sequence of actions for an individual, incorporating actions such as eating or sleeping. Allows for the chaining of `eat` and `sleep` methods, improving code readability and flow. Utilizes JavaScript's event loop to introduce a delay with the `sleep` method before continuing to the next action, demonstrating asynchronous behavior.

```typescript
class LazyMan {
    private taskList: Array<Function>; // Holds a queue of tasks (actions) to be executed.
    private name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.taskList = [];
        setTimeout(() => { // Initiates task execution asynchronously.
            this.next();
        }, 0);
    }

    eat(food: string) {
        this.taskList.push(() => { // Queues an eating action.
            console.log(`eat ${food}`);
            this.next(); // Proceeds to the next queued action.
        });
        return this; // Facilitates method chaining by returning the LazyMan instance.
    }

    sleep(time: number) {
        this.taskList.push(() => { // Queues a sleeping action with a delay.
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log(`wake up after ${time}`);
                this.next(); // Continues to the next action after the delay.
            }, time);
        });
        return this; // Allows for continued chaining.
    }

    next() {
        const fn = this.taskList.shift(); // Dequeues the next action.
        fn && fn(); // Executes the action if it exists.
    }
}

const me = new LazyMan('ronron');
me.eat('apple').sleep(1000).eat('banana').sleep(1000).eat('pear');
```
- **Chainable Methods**: Achieved by returning the instance itself (`this`) from each method, allowing for a fluent interface where methods can be called sequentially on the same object.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Demonstrates the use of JavaScript's `setTimeout` to introduce execution delays, simulating sleep and showcasing asynchronous programming principles. The setTimeout in constructor initiates the asynchronous execution of the first task in the taskList, allowing for a delayed start of the queued actions.The first `this.next` actually starts when the synchronous code finishes, i.e. at `me.eat('apple').sleep(1000).eat('banana').sleep(1000).eat('pear');` line.
