# CSS Selectors and Their Priorities
CSS selectors are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style. These selectors target specific elements based on their attributes, position within the HTML document, and their relationship to other elements.

## Types of CSS Selectors
- **Element Selectors**: Target elements based on their type, e.g., `p`, `div`, `h1`.
- **Class Selectors**: Target elements using their class attribute, prefixed with a dot, e.g., `.className`.
- **ID Selectors**: Target elements using their ID attribute, prefixed with a hash, e.g., `#idName`.
- **Attribute Selectors**: Select elements based on an attribute or attribute value, e.g., `[type="text"]`.
- **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: 
  - Pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:focus` target elements in specific states.
  - Pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` target specific parts of an element.
- **Combinators**: Include child (`>`), descendant (` `), adjacent sibling (`+`), and general sibling (`~`) selectors.

## Selector Specificity and Priorities
- **Specificity Rules**: Specificity determines which CSS rule applies if one element is targeted by multiple rules. The specificity hierarchy from highest to lowest priority is:
  - Inline styles, found within HTML tags.
  - ID selectors.
  - Class, pseudo-class, and attribute selectors.
  - Element selectors.
  - Universal selector (`*`), combinators, and negation pseudo-class (`:not()`), which do not contribute to specificity.
- **Important Note**: The `!important` declaration overrides other declarations but should be used sparingly to avoid complications in debugging.
- **Calculating Specificity**: Specificity is calculated as a numerical value, where:
  - ID selectors contribute the most to specificity.
  - Class, pseudo-classes, and attributes contribute less than IDs but more than elements.

**Examples**
- Example 1: `#header` will override `.main .header` due to higher specificity of the ID selector.
- Example 2: `h1.title` is more specific than `h1` because it combines an element and a class selector.

## Best Practices for Using CSS Selectors
- Maintain simplicity and reusability in selectors to facilitate easier management and maintenance of style sheets.
- Avoid overly specific selectors to ensure CSS remains flexible and manageable.
- Use meaningful class and ID names that reflect the function or content rather than appearance.
