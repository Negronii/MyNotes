# What is the JavaScript Prototype Chain? How is it Formed?
Javascript is sometimes referred to as a "prototype-based language" because it relies heavily on prototypal inheritance. The prototype chain is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. 

When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript will first look for it on the object itself. If it's not found, it will look up the prototype chain to find the property or method on the object's prototype. This process continues up the chain until the property or method is found or until the end of the chain is reached.

The top of the prototype chain is the `Object.prototype` object, which includes common methods and properties like `toString` and `valueOf`. All objects in JavaScript inherit from `Object.prototype`, either directly or indirectly through the prototype chain. That's why you can call methods like `toString` on any object in JavaScript.

## Distinction Between Functions and Objects
JavaScript treats functions as first-class objects, meaning that every function in JavaScript is actually a special type of object. There are two key properties involved in the prototype chain mechanism: `prototype` and `__proto__`.

- **`prototype` Property**: This property is present only in functions. It points to the prototype object that will be assigned as the `__proto__` of instances created by that function when using the `new` keyword.
- **`__proto__` Property**: Every object (including function objects) has this property, which points to the object's prototype, forming a chain up to `null`, the end of the prototype chain.

## Formation of the Prototype Chain

The prototype chain is primarily established through constructor functions and the `new` keyword. Here's how it works step by step:

1. **Constructor Function Creation**: A constructor function is defined by the user. This function has a `prototype` property pointing to an object that will serve as the prototype for instances created from this constructor.

2. **Instance Creation**: When a new instance is created using the `new` keyword, JavaScript automatically sets the instance's internal `[[Prototype]]` property (accessible in most environments as `__proto__`) to the prototype object of the constructor function. This links the new object to its prototype.

3. **Chain Linking**: As each object can have its own prototype, this creates a "chain" of prototypes, ultimately ending at `Object.prototype`, whose `__proto__` is `null`, signifying the end of the prototype chain.

Let's explore a concise example to illustrate these concepts:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name; // Instance property
}

// Adding a method to the Person prototype
Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

// Creating an instance of Person
const alice = new Person('Alice');

// Invoking the sayHello method inherited from Person.prototype
alice.sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice

// Examining the prototype chain of alice
console.log(alice.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true: alice's prototype is Person.prototype
console.log(Person.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true: Person.prototype's prototype is Object.prototype
console.log(Object.prototype.__proto__); // null: Object.prototype is the end of the chain
```

In this example:
- The `alice` instance is linked to `Person.prototype`, and through it, to `Object.prototype`, finally reaching `null`.
- This chain allows `alice.sayHello()` to execute successfully. Although `sayHello` is not a direct property of `alice`, JavaScript engine finds it up the chain in `Person.prototype`.

# Differences between `Object.create` and `{}`
1. **Using `{}` (Object Literals)**: This is the most common way to create an object. The created object inherits from `Object.prototype`, making it an instance of Object.

    ```typescript
    const obj1 = {};
    console.log(obj1.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
    ```

2. **Using `Object.create(proto)`**: This method creates a new object with the specified object as its prototype. This allows for more flexibility in setting up the prototype chain.

    - **`Object.create(Object.prototype)`**: Creates a new object with `Object.prototype` as its prototype, similar to `{}`.
    - **`Object.create({name: 'Tom'})`**: Creates a new object with a custom object (`{name: 'Tom'}`) as its prototype, diverging from `Object.prototype`.

    ```typescript
    const obj2 = Object.create(Object.prototype);
    const obj3 = Object.create({name: 'Tom'});
    console.log(obj2.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
    console.log(obj3.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // false
    ```

# How to Simulate the `new` Operator in JavaScript

When the `new` keyword is used in JavaScript, it performs several actions behind the scenes to create a new instance of an object based on a constructor function. Here's what happens step by step, and how to simulate this process:

1. **Create an empty object** that inherits from the constructor function's prototype.
2. **Execute the constructor function** with the newly created object assigned to `this`.
3. **Return the new object** unless the constructor explicitly returns a different object.

The method to simulate the `new` process can be represented as follows:

```typescript
function _new(fn: Function, ...args: any[]): any {
    const obj = Object.create(fn.prototype); // Step 1
    const res = fn.apply(obj, args); // Step 2
    return res instanceof Object ? res : obj; // Step 3
}

// Test example
function Person(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
}
const person = _new(Person, 'Tom');
console.log(person.name); // Tom
```

## `class` is Syntactic Sugar for Constructor Functions

`class` in JavaScript is essentially syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance and does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model. At its core, a class is just a special type of function, and thus `typeof ClassName === 'function'`.

# Hidden Classes

In JavaScript, **hidden classes** are an optimization mechanism primarily used to enhance the performance of property access in objects. They are an internal feature of the V8 engine (used by Chrome and Node.js) that helps speed up how properties are accessed by dynamically managing the structure of objects.

## How Hidden Classes Work

1. **Object Creation**: When you create an object, the JavaScript engine assigns a hidden class to that object, which contains layout information about its properties.

2. **Adding Properties**: When you add properties to an object, if these properties are added in a consistent order and manner, the JavaScript engine can reuse the existing hidden class or create a new one that reflects the object's structure.

3. **Optimized Access**: By using hidden classes, the JavaScript engine can quickly locate an object's properties without having to search through the entire object, making property access more efficient.

## Example

Consider the following code:

```javascript
function createPoint(x, y) {
    return { x: x, y: y };
}

const p1 = createPoint(1, 2);
const p2 = createPoint(3, 4);
```

In this example, both `p1` and `p2` will have the same hidden class because they have the same structure.

## Benefits of Hidden Classes

- **Shared Structure**: If multiple objects have the same properties and structure, they can share the same hidden class, improving performance.
- **Avoiding Dynamic Modifications**: Frequently adding or removing properties can lead to changes in hidden classes, which can degrade performance. Therefore, it’s best to determine an object’s structure as much as possible at creation time.

## Summary

Hidden classes are an internal mechanism used by JavaScript engines to optimize property access in objects. By designing object structures thoughtfully, you can leverage this mechanism to enhance the execution efficiency of your code.

# Why Define Class Functions in Constructor Prototype?

In JavaScript, using the prototype property of constructor functions to define methods offers substantial benefits in terms of efficiency, inheritance, and code manageability. This section delves into these advantages, supported by a structured, example-driven approach.

## Memory Efficiency
**Utilizing Prototypes**: Implementing methods on the prototype allows these methods to be shared among all instances of the constructor, rather than being duplicated within each instance. This approach significantly conserves memory, which is particularly advantageous in applications generating large numbers of instances, thereby enhancing overall performance.

## Inheritance Support
**Enabling Polymorphism**: Methods defined on the prototype facilitate inheritance across instances and derived classes. This capability is crucial for implementing polymorphic behaviors where methods can be overridden or extended in subclasses, enhancing code reusability and flexibility.

## Dynamic Updates
**Streamlining Code Maintenance**: Adding methods to the prototype ensures that they are instantly available to all existing instances. This feature allows for flexible and swift modifications to the behavior of applications without the need to recreate objects, simplifying ongoing maintenance.

# Constructor Functions and Prototype Properties with the Same Name
```javascript
function Foo(){
    Foo.a = function(){
        console.log(1)
    }
    this.a = function(){
        console.log(2)
    }
}
Foo.prototype.a = function(){
    console.log(3)
}
Foo.a = function(){
    console.log(4)
}
Foo.a(); // Output: 4
let obj = new Foo(); 
obj.a(); // Output: 2
Foo.a(); // Output: 1
```

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Function Definition and Static Property Initialization**

   Initially, a function `Foo` is defined. Following its definition, `Foo.a` is assigned a function that logs `4`. This is a static property of the `Foo` function itself, not of its instances.

2. **Static Method Invocation**

   Invoking `Foo.a()` at this point outputs `4`, as it calls the function assigned to `Foo.a` before any instances of `Foo` are created.

3. **Instance Creation**

   When a new instance of `Foo` is created (`let obj = new Foo()`), several things happen inside the constructor function:
   
   - `Foo.a` is redefined to a function that logs `1`. This redefinition overwrites the initial static definition of `Foo.a` that logged `4`.
   - `this.a` is defined as a function that logs `2`. This assigns an `a` function to the newly created instance, which is separate from `Foo`'s static properties and its prototype.

4. **Instance Method Invocation**

   Invoking `obj.a()` now outputs `2`. This is because the instance (`obj`) has its own `a` property, which takes precedence over the `Foo` prototype's `a` property.

5. **Static Method Post-Instance Invocation**

   Calling `Foo.a()` after creating an instance of `Foo` outputs `1`. This is because the creation of an instance (`new Foo()`) redefined `Foo.a` to a new function that logs `1`.

**Key Takeaways**  
- **Static vs. Instance Properties**: Static properties defined on a constructor function itself (`Foo.a`) are separate from instance properties defined within the constructor using `this` keyword (`this.a`).
- **Prototype Properties**: Properties defined on the prototype (`Foo.prototype.a`) are shared across all instances. However, they have lower precedence compared to instance-specific properties.
- **Precedence and Overwriting**: When accessing a property, instance properties take precedence over prototype properties. Static properties can be redefined, affecting their behavior when accessed before and after instance creation.

# Data Attribute

## Data Property

- **[[configurable]]**: Indicates whether the property can be deleted or modified. If `false`, the property cannot be deleted or changed (except for its value if `writable` is `true`).
- **[[enumerable]]**: Indicates whether the property shows up in a `for...in` loop and `Object.keys` method.
- **[[writable]]**: Indicates whether the value of the property can be changed.
- **[[value]]**: The actual value of the property.

To change the attributes of a data property, you can use `Object.defineProperty` or `Object.defineProperties`.

**Example:**
```javascript
let obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'name', {
  value: 'John',
  writable: false,
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true
});
```

## Accessor Property

- **[[get]]**: A function that is called when the property is accessed. The function should return the value of the property.
- **[[set]]**: A function that is called when the property is assigned a value. The function receives the new value as an argument.
- **[[configurable]]**: Indicates whether the property can be deleted or modified.
- **[[enumerable]]**: Indicates whether the property shows up in a `for...in` loop and `Object.keys` method.

To change the attributes of an accessor property, you can use `Object.defineProperty` or `Object.defineProperties`.

**Example:**
```javascript
let obj = {
  _name: 'John'
};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'name', {
  get() {
    return this._name;
  },
  set(value) {
    this._name = value;
  },
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true
});
```

## GetOwnPropertyDescriptor

`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, prop)` returns the descriptor of the specified property of the object, containing details about the property such as its value, and its attributes like `configurable`, `enumerable`, `writable`, `get`, and `set`.

**Example:**
```javascript
let obj = {
  _name: 'John'
};

// Define a data property
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'name', {
  value: 'John',
  writable: false,
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true
});

// Get the property descriptor
let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, 'name');
// {
//   value: 'John',
//   writable: false,
//   configurable: true,
//   enumerable: true
// }
```

This method is useful for inspecting the attributes of a property to understand its configuration and behavior.
