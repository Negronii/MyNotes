# Flexbox Layout

Flexbox, formally known as the Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns within a container. It allows you to design a complex layout structure with a simpler and more flexible approach.

- **Flex Container**: The element on which `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` is applied. It becomes the flex container, and its children become flex items.
- **Flex Items**: Direct children of the flex container.

## Key Properties

**For the Flex Container**  

- **display**: This defines a flex container; set this to `flex` or `inline-flex`.
- **flex-direction**: This establishes the main-axis, determining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Values: `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse`.
- **flex-wrap**: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property. Values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, `wrap-reverse`.
- **justify-content**: This defines the alignment along the main axis. Values include `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`.
- **align-items**: This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the `justify-content` version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis). Values: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, `stretch`.
- **align-content**: This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how `justify-content` aligns individual items within the main-axis. Note, this property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items. Values: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `stretch`.

**For Flex Items**  

- **flex-grow**: This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.
- **flex-shrink**: This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
- **flex-basis**: This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g., 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword like `auto`.
- **flex**: This is a shorthand for the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties.
- **align-self**: This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by `align-items`) to be overridden for individual flex items.

## Flexbox Use Cases

- **Centering a child element**: Flexbox makes centering items within a container straightforward, both vertically and horizontally.
- **Creating a navigation bar**: Easily align navigation items evenly.
- **Equal height columns/rows**: Even when content size varies.

**Example**

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">3</div>
</div>
```

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Center items horizontally */
  align-items: center; /* Center items vertically */
  height: 200px; /* Define height */
}

.flex-item {
  margin: 5px;
}
```

# Grid Layout

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you layout items into rows and columns.

- **Grid Container**: The element on which `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid` is applied. It becomes the grid container.
- **Grid Item**: The children (direct descendants) of the grid container.
- **Grid Line**: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be horizontal or vertical.
- **Grid Cell**: The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It’s a single "unit" of the grid.
- **Grid Area**: The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells.

## Key Properties

**For the Grid Container**  

- **display**: Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents. Values: `grid`, `inline-grid`.
- **grid-template-columns** / **grid-template-rows**: Defines the columns/rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.
- **grid-gap** (also `row-gap` and `column-gap`): Defines the size of the gap between the rows and columns.
- **justify-items**, **align-items**, **place-items**: Aligns grid items along the row axis, column axis, or both.
- **justify-content**, **align-content**, **place-content**: Aligns the grid itself inside the grid container.

**For Grid Items**  

- **grid-column-start** / **grid-column-end** and **grid-row-start** / **grid-row-end**: Determines a grid item’s location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines.
- **grid-column** / **grid-row**: Shorthand for `grid-column-start`/`end` and `grid-row-start`/`end`.
- **grid-area**: Gives an item a name so it can be referenced by a template created with the `grid-template-areas` property.

## Grid Layout Use Cases

- **Complex layouts**: Ideal for designing layouts with multiple rows and columns, such as magazines and newspapers.
- **Responsive designs**: Easily adjust and reflow content based on screen size.
- **Alignment and spacing**: Precisely control the alignment, spacing, and sizing of grid items.

**Example**  

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
</div>
```

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}

.grid-item {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: lightgrey;
}
```
