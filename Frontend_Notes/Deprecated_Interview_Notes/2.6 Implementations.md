## Implement `LazyMan` Class

The `LazyMan` class simulates a sequence of actions for an individual, incorporating actions such as eating or sleeping. Allows for the chaining of `eat` and `sleep` methods, improving code readability and flow. Utilizes JavaScript's event loop to introduce a delay with the `sleep` method before continuing to the next action, demonstrating asynchronous behavior.

```typescript
class LazyMan {
    private taskList: Array<Function>; // Holds a queue of tasks (actions) to be executed.
    private name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.taskList = [];
        setTimeout(() => { // Initiates task execution asynchronously.
            this.next();
        }, 0);
    }

    eat(food: string) {
        this.taskList.push(() => { // Queues an eating action.
            console.log(`eat ${food}`);
            this.next(); // Proceeds to the next queued action.
        });
        return this; // Facilitates method chaining by returning the LazyMan instance.
    }

    sleep(time: number) {
        this.taskList.push(() => { // Queues a sleeping action with a delay.
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log(`wake up after ${time}`);
                this.next(); // Continues to the next action after the delay.
            }, time);
        });
        return this; // Allows for continued chaining.
    }

    next() {
        const fn = this.taskList.shift(); // Dequeues the next action.
        fn && fn(); // Executes the action if it exists.
    }
}

const me = new LazyMan('ronron');
me.eat('apple').sleep(1000).eat('banana').sleep(1000).eat('pear');
```
- **Chainable Methods**: Achieved by returning the instance itself (`this`) from each method, allowing for a fluent interface where methods can be called sequentially on the same object.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Demonstrates the use of JavaScript's `setTimeout` to introduce execution delays, simulating sleep and showcasing asynchronous programming principles. The setTimeout in constructor initiates the asynchronous execution of the first task in the taskList, allowing for a delayed start of the queued actions.The first `this.next` actually starts when the synchronous code finishes, i.e. at `me.eat('apple').sleep(1000).eat('banana').sleep(1000).eat('pear');` line.

## Implementing a Custom EventBus

An **EventBus** is a design pattern that enhances loose coupling among components within software applications. This pattern allows components to communicate with each other without having direct dependencies or knowledge about each other, thereby promoting modularity and ease of integration.

### Methods
The EventBus pattern is implemented through several methods that manage the lifecycle of events and their listeners:

- **on(event: string, listener: Function)**: Registers a listener to an event. The listener can be triggered multiple times for as long as it remains bound to the event. It remains active until it is explicitly removed with the `off` method.

- **once(event: string, listener: Function)**: Similar to `on`, but the listener is designed to be triggered only once. After it is triggered, the listener is automatically removed. It can also be manually removed before it is triggered by using the `off` method.

- **emit(event: string, ...args: any[])**: Triggers all listeners bound to a specific event, passing along any arguments to the listeners.

- **off(event: string, listener: Function)**: Removes a specific listener from an event. This is crucial for managing the lifecycle of listeners and can be used for listeners registered with both `on` and `once`.

### Data Structure
Internally, the EventBus class uses a `Record<string, Function[]>` to maintain a map between event names and arrays of listener functions. This data structure ensures a systematic and type-safe way to manage event-listener relationships.

### Implementation in TypeScript
```typescript
class EventBus {
    private events: Record<string, Function[]>; // Stores event-to-listener mappings

    constructor() {
        this.events = {};
    }

    // Registers a listener for an event for multiple triggers
    on(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        if (!this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event] = [];
        }
        this.events[event].push(listener);
    }

    // Registers a listener for a single trigger on an event
    once(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        const onceListener = (...args: any[]) => {
            listener(...args); // Trigger the original listener
            this.off(event, onceListener); // Automatically remove after execution
        };
        this.on(event, onceListener); // Use `on` to bind the wrapper listener
    }

    // Triggers all listeners for an event, passing additional arguments
    emit(event: string, ...args: any[]): void {
        if (this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event].forEach(listener => listener(...args));
        }
    }

    // Removes a listener from an event
    off(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        if (this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event] = this.events[event].filter(l => l !== listener);
        }
    }
}

const eventBus = new EventBus();

// Bind the 'click' event
eventBus.on('click', () => console.log('clicked'));

// Bind the 'hover' event for a single-time execution
eventBus.once('hover', () => console.log('hovered'));

// Emit the 'click' event
eventBus.emit('click'); // Output: clicked

// Emit the 'hover' event
eventBus.emit('hover'); // Output: hovered
// Trying to emit 'hover' again will result in no output, as the once-bound listener is removed after execution

// Unbind the 'click' event
const clickListener = () => console.log('clicked');
// Note: This demonstrates the concept, but to successfully unbind, the original function reference must be used
eventBus.off('click', clickListener);
eventBus.emit('click'); // There will be no output if the exact function reference was used for both binding and unbinding
```

## Implementing the Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache Algorithm in JavaScript

The Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache Algorithm is a sophisticated caching mechanism designed to optimize memory usage in applications. It achieves this by maintaining a collection of the most recently accessed items and discarding the least recently used items once the cache reaches its specified capacity. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where memory resources are limited and access patterns are highly variable. At the heart of an LRU Cache are two essential methods: `get` and `put`. 

The `get(key)` method retrieve the value associated with a specific key. Its behavior is twofold:
- **Found Key:** If the key exists in the cache, `get` returns its value. Additionally, it updates the cache to mark the key as recently accessed, effectively moving its associated value to the "end" of the cache, which symbolizes its recent use.
- **Missing Key:** If the key is not present in the cache, `get` returns `-1`, indicating that no value is associated with the key in the cache.

The `put(key, value)` method is responsible for inserting or updating key-value pairs in the cache. Its operation is guided by the following principles:
- **Existing Key:** If the key is already present in the cache, its value is updated, and its position is adjusted to reflect its recent use.
- **New Key with Full Cache:** If the key is new and the cache has reached its maximum capacity, the least recently used item is evicted to accommodate the new key-value pair. This ensures that the cache does not exceed its size limit while prioritizing the retention of recently accessed items.

Leveraging JavaScript's `Map` object, which naturally maintains the order of its elements based on insertion, we can efficiently implement an LRU Cache. The `Map` object's inherent ordering is utilized to track the recency of access for the cache's key-value pairs.

```typescript
class LRUCache {
    private capacity: number;
    private cache: Map<number, number>;

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity; // Define the maximum size of the cache
        this.cache = new Map(); // Utilize a Map for its order-preserving properties
    }

    get(key: number): number {
        if (this.cache.has(key)) {
            const value = this.cache.get(key);
            this.cache.delete(key); // Remove the key to update its position
            this.cache.set(key, value); // Re-insert the key to mark it as recently used
            return value;
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        if (this.cache.has(key)) {
            this.cache.delete(key); // Prepare to update the key's position
        } else if (this.cache.size >= this.capacity) {
            // Cache is full, remove the least recently used item
            const leastUsedKey = this.cache.keys().next().value;
            this.cache.delete(leastUsedKey);
        }
        this.cache.set(key, value); // Insert or update the key-value pair
    }
}

const lruCache = new LRUCache(2); // Initialize a new LRU Cache with a capacity of 2

// Inserting key-value pairs
lruCache.put(1, 1); // Inserts (1, 1)
lruCache.put(2, 2); // Inserts (2, 2)

// Accessing stored values
console.log(lruCache.get(1)); // Outputs: 1 (key 1 is found)

// Inserting another key-value pair, causing the least recently used key (2) to be evicted
lruCache.put(3, 3); // Evicts key 2 and inserts (3, 3)

console.log(lruCache.get(2)); // Outputs: -1 (key 2 has been evicted)

// Further operations demonstrate the LRU eviction policy
lruCache.put(4, 4); // Evicts key 1 and inserts (4, 4)
console.log(lruCache.get(1)); // Outputs: -1 (key 1 has been evicted)
console.log(lru

Cache.get(3)); // Outputs: 3 (key 3 is found)
console.log(lruCache.get(4)); // Outputs: 4 (key 4 is found)
```

## Follow-up: Implementing LRU Cache Without Map or Record

Creating an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache in JavaScript without the built-in `Map` or `Record` types involves a more manual approach to managing memory and order of items. This method uses a hash table for quick access and a doubly linked list to efficiently keep track of the items' order, prioritizing the most recently used.

1. **Doubly Linked List:** Each node in the list corresponds to an item in the cache, equipped with pointers to both the preceding and subsequent items. This bidirectional linking enables quick additions, removals, and reordering of nodes based on access patterns, facilitating the LRU policy's requirement of moving recently accessed items to the forefront.

2. **Hash Table:** For the hash table, a simple JavaScript object (`{}`) suffices. The hash table offers constant-time complexity for key-based operations, such as lookups, insertions, and deletions. It stores references to the nodes in the doubly linked list, thereby bridging the gap between quick access and maintaining order.

```typescript
class ListNode {
    key: number;
    value: number;
    prev: ListNode | null = null;
    next: ListNode | null = null;

    constructor(key: number, value: number) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class LRUCache {
    private capacity: number;
    private hashTable: { [key: number]: ListNode };
    private head: ListNode | null;
    private tail: ListNode | null;

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity; // Defines the cache's maximum size
        this.hashTable = {}; // Key-node reference storage
        this.head = this.tail = null; // Initial empty state for the doubly linked list
    }

    get(key: number): number {
        if (!(key in this.hashTable)) {
            return -1; // Key not found scenario
        }
        const node = this.hashTable[key];
        this.moveToHead(node); // Update access order
        return node.value;
    }

    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        if (key in this.hashTable) {
            const node = this.hashTable[key];
            node.value = value;
            this.moveToHead(node); // Refresh position
        } else {
            const newNode = new ListNode(key, value);
            if (Object.keys(this.hashTable).length === this.capacity) {
                this.removeLRUItem(); // Evict least recently used
            }
            this.hashTable[key] = newNode;
            this.addNode(newNode); // Insert at head
        }
    }

    private addNode(node: ListNode): void {
        // Prepends node to the doubly linked list
        node.next = this.head;
        node.prev = null;
        if (this.head) {
            this.head.prev = node;
        }
        this.head = node;
        if (!this.tail) {
            this.tail = node; // First node becomes both head and tail
        }
    }

    private removeNode(node: ListNode): void {
        // Detaches node from its current position in the list
        if (node.prev) {
            node.prev.next = node.next;
        } else {
            this.head = node.next; // Node is head
        }
        if (node.next) {
            node.next.prev = node.prev;
        } else {
            this.tail = node.prev; // Node is tail
        }
    }

    private moveToHead(node: ListNode): void {
        // Re-positions a node to the head after access
        this.removeNode(node);
        this.addNode(node);
    }

    private removeLRUItem(): void {
        // Evicts the least recently used node from the list's tail
        if (this.tail) {
            delete this.hashTable[this.tail.key]; // Cleanup hash table entry
            this.removeNode(this.tail); // Detach the node
        }
    }
}
```
