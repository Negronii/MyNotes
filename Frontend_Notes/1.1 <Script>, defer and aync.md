# `<script>` Element

The `<script>` element in HTML is used to embed or reference executable JavaScript code within an HTML document. 

## Basic Usage of `<script>`

1. **Embedding JavaScript:**
   ```html
   <script>
     // JavaScript code here
   </script>
   ```

2. **Referencing an External Script:**
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
   ```

## `defer` and `async` Attributes

Both `defer` and `async` attributes are used to control how scripts are loaded and executed, especially for scripts that are referenced from external files.

1. **`defer` Attribute:**

   - The `defer` attribute ensures that the script is executed only after the HTML document has been completely parsed.
   - Scripts with the `defer` attribute are executed in the order they appear in the document.

2. **`async` Attribute:**

   - The `async` attribute allows the script to be executed asynchronously as soon as it is available.
   - Scripts with the `async` attribute are executed as soon as they are downloaded, without waiting for the HTML parsing to complete.
   - The execution order is not guaranteed; scripts may execute in any order.

## When to Use `async` and `defer`

1. **`async`:**
   - Use `async` for scripts that are independent and do not rely on other scripts or the HTML structure.
   - Ideal for analytics scripts, ads, or any script that does not need to manipulate the DOM immediately.

2. **`defer`:**
   - Use `defer` for scripts that need to manipulate the DOM or depend on other scripts.
   - Suitable for scripts that need to maintain order and interact with the document content.

## Best Practices for `<script>` Element

1. **Store JavaScript in External Files:**
   For readability and maintainability, store JavaScript in external files rather than embedding it directly within HTML.
2. **Place `<script>` tags just before the closing `</body>` tag:**
   Ensure the HTML is fully loaded before any script runs.
3. **Minimize and Compress Scripts:**
   - Reduce size and improve load times. Use tools like UglifyJS, Terser.
1. **Use Non-Blocking JavaScript:**
   - Avoid blocking the rendering of the page by using `defer` or `async`.
   - Ensuring that the static content loads first.
