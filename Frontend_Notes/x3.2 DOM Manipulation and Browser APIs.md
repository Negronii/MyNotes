### Find Max Number in a List
#### Method 1: Using Spread Operator with `Math.max`

**Code**:
```ts
function findMaxNumber(arr: number[]): number {
  return Math.max(...arr);
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Utilizes the spread operator `...` to expand the array elements as individual arguments to `Math.max`.
- Simple and clean, but may lead to performance issues or a stack overflow error with very large arrays due to limitations in the number of arguments that can be passed to a function.

#### Method 2: Using `Math.max` with `apply`

**Code**:
```ts
function findMaxNumber(arr: number[]): number {
  return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Similar to the previous method but uses `apply` to pass the array as an argument list to `Math.max`.
- Avoids the potential stack overflow of the spread operator but still may encounter performance issues with very large datasets.

#### Method 3: Using `reduce` Method

**Code**:
```ts
function findMaxNumber(arr: number[]): number {
  return arr.reduce((acc, cur) => acc > cur ? acc : cur, arr[0]);
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Implements the `reduce` function to traverse the array and maintain the highest value found.
- Provides good performance for large arrays and is the most functional programming approach among the listed methods.

#### Method 4: Using `sort`

**Code**:
```ts
function findMaxNumber(arr: number[]): number {
  return arr.sort((a, b) => b - a)[0];
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Sorts the array in descending order and selects the first element.
- This method is less efficient due to the overhead of sorting the entire array and should be used when the smallest or a specific order of elements is also needed.

### Implement a Deep Copy Function

Creating a deep copy function in JavaScript is crucial when you want to duplicate complex data structures without altering the original data. This function must handle various data types, including Maps, Sets, and objects with circular references. The common approach using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` falls short for these use cases due to its limitations with certain data types and structures.

#### Why Not `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`?

Using `JSON.stringify` followed by `JSON.parse` is a quick method to deep copy objects without nested structures or special types. However, this approach has significant limitations:

- **Loses Map and Set data:** When Maps and Sets are passed through this process, they are converted into objects and arrays, respectively, losing their inherent properties and behaviors.
- **Fails with circular references:** If the object contains circular references (objects referencing themselves directly or indirectly), `JSON.stringify` will throw an error, as it cannot serialize cyclic structures.
- **Does not copy special objects correctly:** Certain JavaScript objects like functions, `undefined`, and special objects (e.g., `RegExp`, `Date`) cannot be accurately cloned through this method, resulting in loss of information or incorrect copying.

#### Handling Maps, Sets, and Circular References

To address these limitations, a custom deep copy function is required. This function must thoughtfully handle various data structures, including Maps, Sets, and objects with circular references, ensuring an accurate and efficient cloning process. Below is an enhanced TypeScript implementation that covers these cases effectively:

```typescript
function deepCopy(obj: any, map = new WeakMap()): any {
  // Directly return if obj is null or not an object (e.g., primitives and functions)
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') {
    return obj;
  }

  // Use an existing reference from map if obj was already copied (circular reference handling)
  if (map.has(obj)) {
    return map.get(obj);
  }

  let copy;

  // Clone Date objects by creating a new instance with the same time value
  if (obj instanceof Date) {
    copy = new Date(obj.getTime());
  }
  // Clone RegExp objects by creating a new instance with the same pattern and flags
  else if (obj instanceof RegExp) {
    copy = new RegExp(obj.source, obj.flags);
  }
  // Deep copy Map objects by iterating over entries and recursively copying them
  else if (obj instanceof Map) {
    copy = new Map();
    obj.forEach((value, key) => {
      copy.set(key, deepCopy(value, map));
    });
  }
  // Deep copy Set objects by iterating over values and recursively copying them
  else if (obj instanceof Set) {
    copy = new Set();
    obj.forEach(value => {
      copy.add(deepCopy(value, map));
    });
  }
  // Handle Arrays and plain Objects by creating an empty structure and recursively copying properties
  else {
    copy = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};
    map.set(obj, copy); // Track the object copy to handle circular references
    Object.keys(obj).forEach(key => {
      copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key], map);
    });
  }

  return copy;
}
```

#### Key Points

- **Circular Reference Handling:** Utilizes a `WeakMap` to keep track of previously copied objects. This prevents infinite loops by reusing the copied reference instead of attempting to copy the object again.
- **Special Object Cloning:** Provides tailored cloning strategies for `Date` and `RegExp` objects, ensuring that their unique properties and behaviors are preserved in the copy.
- **Recursive Deep Copy:** Employs a recursive approach to accurately copy nested structures, including objects, arrays, Maps, and Sets. This ensures that the deep copy function can handle complex and deeply nested data structures effectively.

#### Special Object Cloning - `Date` and `RegExp`
`Date` and `RegExp` objects have unique properties and methods that are not enumerable and cannot be copied over by simply iterating over their keys. For instance:
- A `Date` object encapsulates a single moment in time, represented internally as a timestamp (the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch). This value is not directly accessible as an enumerable property that can be copied.
- A `RegExp` object contains a pattern and flags (such as global, multiline, etc.), which are crucial for its operation. These are accessed through properties like source and flags, not directly copyable via key enumeration.

### Implementing a Custom EventBus

An **EventBus** is a design pattern that enhances loose coupling among components within software applications. This pattern allows components to communicate with each other without having direct dependencies or knowledge about each other, thereby promoting modularity and ease of integration.

#### Methods
The EventBus pattern is implemented through several methods that manage the lifecycle of events and their listeners:

- **on(event: string, listener: Function)**: Registers a listener to an event. The listener can be triggered multiple times for as long as it remains bound to the event. It remains active until it is explicitly removed with the `off` method.

- **once(event: string, listener: Function)**: Similar to `on`, but the listener is designed to be triggered only once. After it is triggered, the listener is automatically removed. It can also be manually removed before it is triggered by using the `off` method.

- **emit(event: string, ...args: any[])**: Triggers all listeners bound to a specific event, passing along any arguments to the listeners.

- **off(event: string, listener: Function)**: Removes a specific listener from an event. This is crucial for managing the lifecycle of listeners and can be used for listeners registered with both `on` and `once`.

#### Data Structure
Internally, the EventBus class uses a `Record<string, Function[]>` to maintain a map between event names and arrays of listener functions. This data structure ensures a systematic and type-safe way to manage event-listener relationships.

#### Implementation in TypeScript
```typescript
class EventBus {
    private events: Record<string, Function[]>; // Stores event-to-listener mappings

    constructor() {
        this.events = {};
    }

    // Registers a listener for an event for multiple triggers
    on(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        if (!this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event] = [];
        }
        this.events[event].push(listener);
    }

    // Registers a listener for a single trigger on an event
    once(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        const onceListener = (...args: any[]) => {
            listener(...args); // Trigger the original listener
            this.off(event, onceListener); // Automatically remove after execution
        };
        this.on(event, onceListener); // Use `on` to bind the wrapper listener
    }

    // Triggers all listeners for an event, passing additional arguments
    emit(event: string, ...args: any[]): void {
        if (this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event].forEach(listener => listener(...args));
        }
    }

    // Removes a listener from an event
    off(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        if (this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event] = this.events[event].filter(l => l !== listener);
        }
    }
}

const eventBus = new EventBus();

// Bind the 'click' event
eventBus.on('click', () => console.log('clicked'));

// Bind the 'hover' event for a single-time execution
eventBus.once('hover', () => console.log('hovered'));

// Emit the 'click' event
eventBus.emit('click'); // Output: clicked

// Emit the 'hover' event
eventBus.emit('hover'); // Output: hovered
// Trying to emit 'hover' again will result in no output, as the once-bound listener is removed after execution

// Unbind the 'click' event
const clickListener = () => console.log('clicked');
// Note: This demonstrates the concept, but to successfully unbind, the original function reference must be used
eventBus.off('click', clickListener);
eventBus.emit('click'); // There will be no output if the exact function reference was used for both binding and unbinding
```

### Front-End Storage Options

Understanding the different storage options available in front-end development is crucial for managing data efficiently and enhancing user experience. Each storage mechanism has its unique features, capacity, and use cases. Here, we'll explore three primary storage spaces: `LocalStorage`, `SessionStorage`, and `Cookies`, focusing on their characteristics, benefits, and practical applications.

#### LocalStorage

LocalStorage provides a way to store data persistently on the client's browser. It's a key-value storage mechanism that allows data to remain saved across browser sessions and even after the browser is closed and reopened.

**Features:**

- **Persistent Storage:** Data remains until it's explicitly removed via script or by the user, making it reliable for long-term data storage.
- **Capacity:** Offers around 5MB of storage per domain, which is sufficient for most use cases without impacting performance.
- **Access:** Data is accessible synchronously, ensuring easy retrieval from the same domain without involving server requests.

**Uses:**

- Ideal for saving user preferences, themes, or other settings that enhance the user experience.
- Caching application data to speed up load times and reduce dependency on network requests.
- Storing game progress or application states that can be resumed later.

#### SessionStorage

SessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage in many ways but is designed for storage that lasts only for the duration of the page session. It's perfect for data that doesn't need to persist beyond the current tab or window.

**Features:**

- **Tab-Specific Storage:** Unique storage space for each tab or window, cleared automatically when the tab or window is closed.
- **Capacity:** Also offers about 5MB of storage per domain, aligning with LocalStorage.
- **Access:** Allows for synchronous access within the same domain, facilitating quick data retrieval for the session's duration.

**Uses:**

- Suitable for storing data related to user input, form states, or selections within a single session, preventing data loss when navigating pages.
- Temporary storage of application states that should not be retained after the session ends.
- Facilitating state management in single-page applications (SPAs) for a seamless user experience without persisting data beyond necessity.

#### Cookies

Cookies are fundamentally different from LocalStorage and SessionStorage in that they are intended to be sent to and from the server with each HTTP request. This makes them a powerful tool for session management and tracking user activity.

**Features:**

- **Server Communication:** Automatically included with every HTTP request, making them ideal for authentication and state management.
- **Capacity:** Limited to about 4KB per cookie, which constrains their use to smaller data sets.
- **Expiration:** Can be set with a specific expiration date, after which they're deleted automatically, supporting both session-based and persistent storage strategies.

**Uses:**

- Managing user sessions by storing session identifiers, enabling users to remain logged in between visits.
- Storing user preferences or settings that influence server-side rendering or content delivery.
- Implementing tracking mechanisms for analytics, user behavior analysis, or targeted advertising.

#### Choosing the Right Storage Mechanism

- **LocalStorage** shines for storing larger amounts of data that need to persist over long periods, without the overhead of server communication. It's best for enhancing client-side experience with minimal impact on performance.
- **SessionStorage** offers a transient storage solution for sensitive or temporary data, ensuring that information is not retained beyond the necessary scope of the user's session.
- **Cookies** remain a staple for scenarios requiring server-side access to client data, especially for authentication, session management, and personalization efforts. Their small size and automatic transmission with HTTP requests make them indispensable for certain tasks, albeit with considerations for security and performance.

### Difference between HTMLCollection and NodeList

HTML and the Document Object Model (DOM) are essential components of web development. Understanding different parts of the DOM, such as `HTMLCollection` and `NodeList`, is crucial for manipulating web pages effectively.

- **HTMLCollection**: This is a live collection of HTML elements. It updates automatically when the DOM changes. `HTMLCollection` exclusively contains `Element` nodes, typically returned by methods like `document.getElementsByClassName` and the `.children` property of an element.

- **NodeList**: A more general collection that can include different types of nodes, not just elements. This can be live or static, depending on how it's obtained. For example, `NodeList` returned by `Node.childNodes` is live, but the one returned by `document.querySelectorAll` is static.

#### Difference between HTMLCollection and NodeList

1. **Node Types**: `HTMLCollection` is limited to `Element` nodes, while `NodeList` can include any node types, such as `Element`, `Text`, and `Comment`.

2. **Dynamism**: `HTMLCollection` is always live, meaning it reflects DOM changes immediately. `NodeList` can be either live or static. Live `NodeList`s reflect DOM changes, whereas static ones do not.

#### `.children` vs `.childNodes`

Considering the following HTML snippet:

```html
<p id='p1'>
    <em>hello</em> hello <b>bold</b><!-- comment -->
</p>
```

- `p.children` refers to an `HTMLCollection` containing only element nodes within `p` (`<em>` and `<b>` in this case). It does not include text nodes or comments.

- `p.childNodes` refers to a `NodeList` and includes all node types - `Element`, `Text`, and `Comment`. It will contain `<em>`, text nodes (including the 'hello' text), `<b>`, and the comment node.

- `p.tagName` and `p.nodeName` are properties used to get the tag name of an element. `p.tagName` is used specifically for elements and returns the tag name in uppercase, while `p.nodeName` is applicable to all types of nodes and returns the name of the node (the tag name for elements in uppercase).

In summary, `HTMLCollection` and `NodeList` are key concepts in DOM manipulation, each with its specific use cases. Understanding their differences is vital for efficient and effective front-end web development.

### Describe JS-bridge principles

#### What is JS-bridge
JSBridge serves as a middleware between native applications and JavaScript running within a webview. JavaScript cannot directly invoke native APIs due to the sandboxed nature of web content for security reasons. A JSBridge provides a structured interface through which JavaScript can communicate with the native side of an application. This enables web content to access device features or native functionality that is otherwise inaccessible to pure web applications. For example, within the Facebook app, it's possible to open H5 websites; this is facilitated by JSBridge, allowing the web content to interact with the app's native features.

#### Frequent used methods to achieve JS-Bridge

1. **Global API Registration**: This method involves exposing native functions as global JavaScript functions that can be called directly from the web content. However, this approach may encounter issues with asynchronous execution, such as delays in reading from local files or fetching data over the network. For example:

```js
// Incorrect: const version = window.getVersion() // getVersion is from bridge, but have problem of lag at async, e.g. read from local file or web
async function getVersion() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (window.bridge && window.bridge.getVersion) {
      resolve(window.bridge.getVersion());
    } else {
      reject('Bridge or getVersion method not found.');
    }
  });
}
```

2. **URL Scheme (Recommended)**: This technique involves defining custom URL schemes that the native application can recognize and handle. When a webview navigates to a URL with a custom scheme, the app intercepts the request and performs the corresponding native action. This method is more flexible and allows for easy asynchronous communication. A common implementation involves creating invisible iframes to trigger these URL schemes without navigating away from the current page. The example provided showcases an SDK object encapsulating calls to different native functions via URL schemes:

```js
// Example of an SDK object to interface with native app functions through URL schemes
const sdk = {
    invoke(url, data, onSuccess, onError) {
        const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
        iframe.style.visibility = 'hidden';
        document.body.appendChild(iframe);
        iframe.onload = () => {
            try {
                const content = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML;
                onSuccess(JSON.parse(content));
            } catch (error) {
                onError(error);
            } finally {
                iframe.remove();
            }
        };
        iframe.onerror = (error) => {
            onError(error);
            iframe.remove();
        };
        iframe.src = `my-app-name://${url}?data=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data))}`;
    },
    fn1(data, onSuccess, onError) {
        this.invoke('api/fn1', data, onSuccess, onError);
    },
    fn2(data, onSuccess, onError) {
        this.invoke('api/fn2', data, onSuccess, onError);
    },
    fn3(data, onSuccess, onError) {
        this.invoke('api/fn3', data, onSuccess, onError);
    }
};
```

### How are Hybrid Templates Updated?
#### Template Management and Version Control
Effective template management is achieved through systematic version control and careful organization:

1. **CMS Upload:** Templates are uploaded to a template server via a content management system (CMS), ensuring that all digital assets are centrally managed.
2. **Version Tagging:** Each template upload is tagged with a unique version identifier (e.g., v1.0, v1.1). This practice supports effective iteration management, facilitates easy rollback in case of issues, and simplifies version comparisons.

#### Template Integration in Applications
Templates are integrated into applications through a series of steps that ensure their proper utilization and rendering:

1. **Template Retrieval:** Applications fetch the latest template versions from the server as needed, downloading essential files including HTML, JavaScript (JS), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
2. **Webview Rendering:** The application's view layer utilizes a webview to render the downloaded content. Files are accessed through a URL scheme (e.g., `file://`), allowing for isolated and secure rendering within the app.
3. **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Webviews make AJAX calls to an API server to retrieve necessary data. This data is then dynamically populated into the HTML templates, creating a personalized user experience.

#### Template Update Triggers
The timing of template updates is crucial to maintain both performance and user experience:

- **At Launch:** Each time the application is launched, it checks for and downloads any available new templates.
- **Periodic Updates:** Regular checks (e.g., every 5 minutes) are scheduled to ensure the application has the most current template, balancing the need for freshness with performance considerations.

#### Managing Template Updates
The update process is designed to minimize disruption and maximize application performance:

1. **Performance Considerations:** Direct downloads of new templates at the time of detection can adversely affect the app’s responsiveness, particularly under poor network conditions.
2. **Background Processing:** To avoid performance hits, new templates are downloaded in the background, allowing the application to continue operating with the current version until the update is ready.
3. **Seamless Switch:** Upon successful download, the application seamlessly transitions to the new template version without interrupting the user experience, ensuring a smooth and imperceptible update process.

### Browser Event Transfer Process

Events in the DOM can propagate in two key phases: capturing and bubbling. This section explains these phases and how React manages event propagation using its synthetic event system.

#### Event Propagation Phases

**Event propagation** in the DOM occurs in three distinct phases:

##### 1. Capture Phase
- **Description**: During the capture phase, the event starts from the root node of the DOM and travels downward towards the target node, passing through each intermediary node.
- **Purpose**: This phase allows for the interception of events before they reach their intended target.

##### 2. Target Phase
- **Description**: The target phase is where the event reaches the element that triggered the event.
- **Interaction**: Here, event listeners attached directly to the target node are executed.

##### 3. Bubble Phase
- **Description**: After reaching the target, the event then bubbles up from the target node back to the root of the DOM.
- **Utility**: This phase is used for event delegation, allowing for more efficient memory usage and less complex event management in applications.

#### Event Binding in React

React abstracts the DOM's event propagation mechanism through what is known as the **Synthetic Event System**:

- **Synthetic Events**: React creates a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. This is known as a synthetic event. It has the same interface as the browser’s native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except events work identically across all browsers.
- **Event Delegation**: Instead of binding events to the node itself, React binds events to the document's root node and uses event bubbling to manage events. This helps in optimizing performance and simplifying event handling.
- **Phases Combination**: React does not use the capture phase for most events, but it provides an option to handle an event in the capture phase by appending `Capture` to the event handler's name (e.g., `onClickCapture`).

### How to Implement Multi-Tab Communication on a Website?

Implementing multi-tab communication in web applications allows for the sharing of data and messages between different tabs or windows of the same origin. Here are three common methods to achieve this, along with their advantages, limitations, and use cases.

#### 1. Using WebSockets
WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, enabling real-time data exchange between the client and server.

- **Advantages**:
  - No CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) limitations, allowing for communication across different domains.
  - Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

- **Limitations**:
  - Requires server-side support, which can be more costly and complex to implement compared to client-side-only solutions.
  - Maintaining a WebSocket connection can be resource-intensive for both the server and client.

- **Use Case**:
  Ideal for applications that require real-time data exchange, such as live chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative editing tools.

#### 2. Using `localStorage`
`localStorage` is a web storage API that allows data to be stored in key-value pairs in the browser, and it can be used for communication between tabs within the same origin.

- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement and does not require server-side support.
  - Works across tabs within the same origin, making it suitable for sharing data between different parts of the same application.

- **Limitations**:
  - Limited to communication within the same origin.
  - Storage space is limited (typically around 5MB).

- **Example Code**:
  ```html
  <!-- In one tab (e.g., list page) -->
  <script>
      window.addEventListener('storage', event => {
          if (event.key === 'changeInfo') {
              console.info('New info received:', event.newValue);
          }
      });
  </script>
  <!-- In another tab (e.g., detail page) -->
  <script>
      document.getElementById('btn1').addEventListener('click', () => {
          const newInfo = {
              id: 100,
              name: 'Item ' + Date.now()
          };
          localStorage.setItem('changeInfo', JSON.stringify(newInfo));
      });
  </script>
  ```
  - **Key Points**:
    - Tabs A and B are within the same origin.
    - Tab A sets `localStorage`, and Tab B listens for changes in `localStorage`.

#### 3. Using `SharedWorker`
`SharedWorker` is a type of Web Worker that allows for the creation of a shared execution environment, accessible by multiple scripts even if they are in different windows, iframes, or tabs.

- **Advantages**:
  - Enables communication and data sharing between tabs, iframes, or windows from the same origin.
  - Offloads work to a background thread, preventing UI blocking.

- **Limitations**:
  - More complex to implement and test compared to other methods.
  - Support across browsers can be inconsistent.
  - Limited to same-origin communication.

- **Example Code**:
  ```html
  <!-- In one tab (e.g., list) -->
  <script>
      const worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
      worker.port.onmessage = e => console.info('Message from worker:', e.data);
  </script>
  <!-- In another tab (e.g., detail) -->
  <script>
      const worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
      document.getElementById('btn1').addEventListener('click', () => {
          worker.port.postMessage('Message from detail tab');
      });
  </script>
  ```
  ```js
  // worker.js
  const ports = new Set();
  onconnect = event => {
      const port = event.ports[0];
      ports.add(port);
      port.onmessage = e => {
          // Broadcast the message to all connected ports except the sender
          ports.forEach(p => {
              if (p !== port) {
                  p.postMessage(e.data);
              }
          });
      };
      port.postMessage('SharedWorker initialized');
  }
  ```
  - **Key Points**:
    - `SharedWorker` can start a shared process for communication between tabs from the same origin.
    - It is capable of running JavaScript in the background, independent of any particular tab, allowing for more complex inter-tab communication scenarios.

#### How to Achieve Communication Between a Website and an Iframe

Communicating between a website and an iframe can be efficiently achieved using the `window.postMessage()` method. This approach allows for secure cross-origin communication without being restricted by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies. The `postMessage` method enables sending data from the parent page to an iframe or vice versa, regardless of their origin, ensuring a versatile and secure way to interact across different domains.

- **Advantages**:
  - Bypasses CORS restrictions, enabling communication across different origins.
  - Provides a mechanism to verify the origin of the messages, enhancing security.

- **Example Code**:

  - **Child (Iframe Content)**:
    ```html
    <!-- Child HTML content -->
    <p>Child page
      <button id="btn1">Send Message</button>
    </p>
    <script>
        const btn1 = document.getElementById('btn1');
        btn1.addEventListener('click', () => {
            console.info('Child button clicked');
            window.parent.postMessage('Message from child', '*'); // Use specific origin instead of '*' in production
        });

        window.addEventListener('message', event => {
            // Always check the origin of the data!
            if (/* validate event.origin */) {
                console.info('Origin:', event.origin);
                console.info('Child received:', event.data);
            }
        });
    </script>
    ```
  - **Parent**:
    ```html
    <!-- Parent HTML content -->
    <p>Index page
      <button id="btn1">Send Message</button>
    </p>
    <iframe id="iframe1" src="./child.html"></iframe>
    <script>
        const btn1 = document.getElementById('btn1');
        const iframe = document.getElementById('iframe1');

        btn1.addEventListener('click', () => {
            console.info('Parent button clicked');
            iframe.contentWindow.postMessage('Message from parent', '*'); // Use specific origin instead of '*' in production
        });

        window.addEventListener('message', event => {
            // Always validate the origin of the data!
            if (/* validate event.origin */) {
                console.info('Origin:', event.origin);
                console.info('Parent received:', event.data);
            }
        });
    </script>
    ```
- **Key Points**:
  - The `'*'` argument in `postMessage` indicates that the message can be sent to any origin. In production environments, this should be replaced with the specific target origin to prevent security vulnerabilities.
  - It's crucial to validate the `event.origin` in the message event listener to ensure that messages are only accepted from trusted sources. This validation prevents potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### What is `window.requestIdleCallback`? What's the difference between `requestIdleCallback` and `requestAnimationFrame`?

`window.requestIdleCallback` is a method that allows developers to queue a function to be executed when the browser is idle. This API provides an opportunity to perform background and low-priority work without interfering with critical animations or input response times. It's particularly useful for tasks that aren't time-critical, such as analytics and background data processing.

#### React Fiber

React Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It changes the component tree structure to a linked list, enabling incremental rendering. This means that rendering work can be split into chunks and spread out over multiple frames. Fiber's architecture allows React to pause rendering to handle more urgent tasks and then resume when the browser is idle. This is where `requestIdleCallback` becomes relevant; it provides a native way to schedule these low-priority tasks during idle times, enhancing performance without sacrificing user experience.

However, it's important to note that `requestIdleCallback` may have compatibility issues with Safari and Internet Explorer.

#### Difference between `requestIdleCallback` and `requestAnimationFrame`

- **`requestAnimationFrame`** is designed for animations and executes just before each repaint, ensuring smooth visual updates. It has a higher priority because maintaining a high frame rate is crucial for animations and user interface responsiveness.
- **`requestIdleCallback`**, on the other hand, is intended for tasks that can wait until the main thread is idle. It runs with lower priority, making it suitable for non-urgent tasks that don't need to be completed immediately.

Both `requestAnimationFrame` and `requestIdleCallback` are considered macro tasks in the JavaScript event loop, but they serve different purposes based on their execution timing and priority levels.

### Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern is widely used in front-end development. It involves a subject and observers, where the observers are notified and updated whenever the subject undergoes a change. A common example is attaching click event listeners to a button, where each listener acts as an observer to the button's click event.

**Example**:
```typescript
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('click');
});
```

### Publish-Subscribe Pattern
Similar to the Observer pattern, the Publish-Subscribe pattern provides a more decoupled way for components to communicate. Components can publish events to a specific event channel and subscribe to this channel to receive notifications. It's important to unsubscribe from events, especially in component lifecycle hooks, to prevent memory leaks.

**Example**:
```typescript
event.on('event-key', () => {
    console.log('event 1');
});
event.on('event-key', () => {
    console.log('event 2');
});
event.emit('event-key');

// Remember to unsubscribe
function fn1() {}
event.on('event-key', fn1);
event.off('event-key', fn1);
```
