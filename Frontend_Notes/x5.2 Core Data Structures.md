### In-order, pre-order and post-order
In the context of binary trees, in-order, pre-order, and post-order refer to the three primary ways to traverse the nodes of the tree, each with a different order for visiting the nodes.
**In-Order Traversal**: Left, Root, Right.
**Pre-Order Traversal**: Root, Left, Right.
**Post-Order Traversal**: Left, Right, Root.

### find the kth smallest value in a binary search tree
```ts
interface ITreeNode{
    val: number;
    left: ITreeNode | null;
    right: ITreeNode | null;
}

function findKthSmallest(root:ITreeNode, k: number): number | null {
    let count: number = 0;
    let result: number | null = null;

    // this function is in-order
    function dfsHelper(curNode: ITreeNode) {
        if (curNode === null || result !== null) return;

        dfsHelper(curNode.left);

        if (++count === k) {
            result = curNode.val;
            return;
        }

        dfsHelper(curNode.right);
    }

    dfsHelper(root);

    return result;
}
```

### Why binary tree so important, not trinary or quanary tree? 
While arrays provide faster access (O(1)), adding or deleting elements is less efficient (O(N)). Linked lists offer efficient insertion and deletion (O(1)), but slower access times (O(N)).

Compared to arrays and linked lists, binary trees offer a good balance with O(logn) time complexity for access, add, and delete operations when the tree is balanced.

Binary trees, as opposed to ternary or quaternary trees, provide a simpler and more efficient structure for most applications. They strike a balance between maintaining low complexity and achieving efficient operations.

### Why balancing binary tree so important?
An unbalanced binary tree can degenerate into a linked list, leading to O(N) time complexity for operations like add, delete, update, and search. A balanced binary tree, on the other hand, maintains a height of O(logn), ensuring that operations can be performed in logarithmic time. This balance is essential for leveraging the efficiency of binary trees, especially in scenarios where quick search, insertion, and deletion are frequently required.

### Why tree operations has time complexity of O(logn)?
`logn` represents the height of a balanced binary tree. In a balanced tree, each operation like search, insert, or delete involves traversing a path from the root to a leaf node, or vice versa. The number of levels (or height) of the tree determines the maximum number of steps needed for these operations. Since a balanced binary tree is structured to have a height that grows logarithmically with the number of nodes (n), the operations are significantly more efficient than linear time complexity, particularly for large datasets.

### What is a black-red tree? What is B tree? 
- **Red-Black Tree**: It is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node in the tree is colored either red or black. The tree uses these colors along with specific rules to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. The time complexity for balancing a Red-Black Tree during insertions and deletions is O(log n). This balancing act ensures that the tree maintains its O(logn) time complexity for operations. Red-Black Trees are particularly valued for their relatively simple balancing logic and efficient operations, making them suitable for various applications, including implementing associative arrays and priority queues.

- **B-Tree**: A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. Unlike binary trees, B-Trees are multi-way trees (having more than two children) and are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, like databases and filesystems. They are designed to efficiently minimize disk I/O operations, and their branching factor (the number of child nodes) can be adjusted to optimize the balance between the tree's height and the number of nodes accessed per operation.

- **B+ Tree**: A variant of the B-Tree, the B+ Tree, is commonly used in databases and file systems. It maintains data in the leaf nodes, while the internal nodes store only keys for navigation. This design allows for efficient range queries and sequential access, making B+ Trees well-suited for systems that require high-performance data retrieval. See https://blog.csdn.net/Weixiaohuai/article/details/109493541

Both Red-Black Trees and B-Trees are advanced tree structures designed to optimize performance for different scenarios, with Red-Black Trees often used in memory and B-Trees in disk-based storage systems.

### Identify whether a string is prefix of a word in dictionary
A Trie, or a prefix tree, is an optimal data structure for this problem. It stores strings in a tree-like structure, where each node represents a character of a string. The root represents an empty string, and each path from the root to a leaf node represents a word.

To check if a string is a prefix of any word in the dictionary, we insert each word into the Trie. Then, for the given string, we traverse the Trie from the root. If we can traverse the Trie following the characters of the string without any breaks, and reach a node (not necessarily a leaf node), then the string is a valid prefix in the dictionary.

This approach is efficient in terms of time complexity, especially for multiple prefix searches, as each search is only as long as the length of the string being searched.

e.g. word apple may looks like this: {a: {p: {p: {l: {e: null}}}}}

The time complexity for this is O(m) where m is the length of the string

### Depth-First Search (DFS) of a DOM Tree
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a method used to traverse or search a tree or graph data structure. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. When applied to a DOM tree, DFS will visit each node in a manner that deeply explores a node's children before moving to its siblings.

The given TypeScript function `dfs` illustrates how DFS can be applied to a DOM tree. The `visitNode` function is used to log different types of nodes (Comment, Text, HTMLElement). In the `dfs` function, recursion is utilized to visit each node starting from the root, exploring all its child nodes deeply before moving to the next sibling.

```typescript
function visitNode(node: Node) {
    if (node instanceof Comment) {
        console.log('comment', node.textContent);
    }
    if (node instanceof Text) {
        const t = node.textContent.trim();
        if (t) {
            console.log('text', t);
        }
    }
    if (node instanceof HTMLElement) {
        console.log('element', node.tagName);
    }
}

function dfs(node: Node) {
    visitNode(node);
    node.childNodes.forEach((child) => {
        dfs(child);
    });
}
```

#### Without Recursion
DFS can be implemented without recursion by using a stack to simulate the call stack of recursion. This approach avoids potential stack overflow errors that may occur with deep recursion. While recursion is more straightforward and readable, using a stack can be more efficient and safer for deep trees.

```typescript
function dfsWithoutRecursion(node: Node) {
    const stack = [node];
    while (stack.length) {
        const n = stack.pop();
        visitNode(n);
        Array.from(n.childNodes).reverse().forEach((child) => {
            stack.push(child);
        });
    }
}
```

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) of a DOM Tree
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another method to traverse or search a tree or graph data structure. Unlike DFS, BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Applied to a DOM tree, BFS will visit each node level by level.

The `bfs` function demonstrates how BFS can be applied to a DOM tree. It uses a queue to visit each node at the current level before moving to the nodes at the next level. This approach ensures that nodes are visited in a breadth-wise manner.

```typescript
function bfs(node: Node) {
    const queue = [node];
    while (queue.length) {
        const n = queue.shift();
        visitNode(n);
        n.childNodes.forEach((child) => {
            queue.push(child);
        });
    }
}
```

#### Key Differences Between DFS and BFS
- **DFS** dives as deep as possible into the tree's branches before backtracking, which can be implemented either recursively or using a stack.
- **BFS** visits all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level, using a queue to keep track of the order.

### Array to Tree and Tree to Array Conversion
#### TreeNode and ArrayItem Interfaces
```typescript
interface TreeNode {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    children?: TreeNode[];
}

interface ArrayItem {
    id: number;
    parentId: number;
    name: string;
}
```

#### Array to Tree Conversion
```typescript
function arrayToTree(arr: ArrayItem[]): TreeNode | null {
    const map = new Map<number, TreeNode>();
    let root: TreeNode | null = null;

    // sort by parentId to ensure parent nodes are processed before children
    arr.sort((a, b) => a.parentId - b.parentId);

    arr.forEach(item => {
        const {id, parentId, name} = item;
        const treeNode: TreeNode = {id, name, children: []};
        map.set(id, treeNode);

        if (parentId === 0) {
            root = treeNode;
        } else {
            const parent = map.get(parentId);
            parent?.children.push(treeNode);
        }
    });

    return root;
}
```

#### Tree to Array Conversion
```typescript
function treeToArray(tree: TreeNode): ArrayItem[] {
    const result: ArrayItem[] = [];

    function traverse(node: TreeNode, parentId: number) {
        const {id, name, children} = node;
        result.push({id, parentId, name});
        children?.forEach(child => traverse(child, id));
    }

    traverse(tree, 0);
    return result;
}
```

#### Contextual Understanding
- **Relational Databases**: Such as PostgreSQL, typically store data in a tabular format with rows and columns, which resembles the flat array structure. This format is efficient for operations that involve relations between different entities.
  
- **Non-relational Databases**: For instance, MongoDB, often store data in formats akin to the tree structure, like documents in BSON format. This structure is advantageous for storing nested or hierarchical data, such as comments on a post or categories with subcategories.
