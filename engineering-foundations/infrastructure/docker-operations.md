# Docker Operations / Docker操作参考

**镜像 / Image** is a read-only template of filesystem layers and configuration. **容器 / Container** is a created or running instance with a writable layer and optional mounts. Removing a container removes its writable layer; named volumes persist outside that container lifecycle.

镜像定义运行环境，容器承载一次运行实例；持久数据、网络访问和运行时凭据要分别配置，删除容器也不等于备份数据。

Before starting a fresh `postgres:16` instance in the examples below, provide a non-empty `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` through the shell environment or a secret manager. The official image requires it to initialize an empty data directory; it can be passed at runtime without placing a credential in the image or source file. Changing the variable later does not rotate a password in an already initialized volume.

## Common operations

| Task | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Download an image | `docker pull redis:7` | Pin a tag or digest when repeatability matters; a tag may move. |
| List local images | `docker image ls` | Images can have multiple tags. |
| Create and start a container | `docker run --name cache -d redis:7` | Pulls the image if it is not available locally. |
| List running containers | `docker ps` | Add `-a` to include stopped containers. |
| Stop / start a container | `docker stop cache` / `docker start cache` | A stopped container still exists. |
| Read container logs | `docker logs cache` | Add `-f` to follow new output. |
| Run a command in a running container | `docker exec -it cache /bin/sh` | Run only when the image includes `/bin/sh`; minimal images may contain no shell. |
| Remove a stopped container | `docker rm cache` | `-f` also stops and removes a running container. |
| Remove an image | `docker image rm redis:7` | Refer to an image tag or image ID, not a container ID. |

Detached mode (such as `docker run -d`) returns the terminal while the container's main process runs. It does not supervise an application or guarantee that the container stays healthy. Use `docker ps` and `docker logs` to inspect it.

## Publish ports

A port mapping forwards a host port to a port in the container. This publishes a container service to the host network; it does not make the service healthy or authenticated.

~~~bash
docker run -d --name cache -p 127.0.0.1:6000:6379 redis:7
~~~

Binding to `127.0.0.1` limits host access to the local machine. Omitting the host IP generally publishes on all host interfaces, subject to the host and Docker networking configuration. Container-to-container traffic on a shared Docker network normally uses the container port directly, not a published host port.

---

## Networks

A user-defined bridge network lets attached containers communicate by container or service name through Docker's embedded DNS. Network membership controls which containers can connect at the Docker network layer; it is not application authentication or authorization.

~~~bash
docker network create app-net
docker run -d --name db --network app-net \
  --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD postgres:16
~~~

Only expose a host port when a process outside the network needs to connect. In Compose, services join a project network by default and can usually use each other's service names as hostnames.

---

## Volumes and persistent data

Container writable layers are removed with their containers. A **named volume / 命名卷** is managed by Docker and remains after the container is removed. A **bind mount / 绑定挂载** maps a host path into the container and is useful when both host and container need the files. A volume is not a backup; plan backups and restore tests separately.

Omitting the volume source creates an anonymous volume with a generated name; it normally persists after container removal but is not automatically reused by a later container.

~~~bash
docker volume create db-data
docker run -d --name db --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD \
  --mount type=volume,src=db-data,dst=/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:16
~~~

The destination path belongs to the image or application, so check that product's documentation. Compose declares named volumes at the top level:

~~~yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?set POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
~~~

Compose normally preserves declared named volumes on `docker compose down`. Adding `-v` removes project volumes and their data; review that effect before using it.

---

## Compose

Compose describes a multi-container application in a YAML file. The default project network provides service-name discovery, so an application container can address the database as `db` on its container port. Publish a port only when the host or another external network needs access.

~~~yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    environment:
      DATABASE_HOST: db
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?set POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
~~~

~~~bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f app
docker compose down
~~~

The current Compose Specification is used by Compose V2. Its top-level `version` field is obsolete and does not select a schema version. The older standalone `docker-compose` command is a legacy interface; use `docker compose` with the Compose CLI plugin.

---

## Dockerfile and image builds

A Dockerfile describes image build steps. `RUN` executes during build; `CMD` supplies a default command or arguments when a container starts; `ENTRYPOINT` defines the executable to run. A runtime command can override `CMD`.

~~~dockerfile
FROM node:22-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:22-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
~~~

Build with `docker build -t my-app:1.0 .`. This example assumes a package lockfile. The build context is the set of files sent to the builder; use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude files such as local dependencies, version-control data, and secrets. Multi-stage builds keep build-only stages out of the final image unless files are copied from them. Copy only the runtime files and dependencies the application needs.

Do not put credentials in a Dockerfile's `ENV` or `ARG` values. Use a BuildKit secret mount for a credential needed during build; it is made available to the build instruction without baking it into the image. At runtime, Compose secrets can be granted to selected services and mounted as files; protect the source secret file and host.

~~~dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=npmrc,target=/root/.npmrc npm ci
~~~

~~~bash
docker build --secret id=npmrc,src=.npmrc -t my-app:1.0 .
~~~

To push an image to a registry, authenticate with that registry, tag the image with its repository address, and push the tag. These commands use placeholders; `docker login` prompts or uses configured credentials, which should not be committed:

~~~bash
docker login registry.example.com
docker tag my-app:1.0 registry.example.com/team/my-app:1.0
docker push registry.example.com/team/my-app:1.0
~~~
