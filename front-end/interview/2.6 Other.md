## JavaScript's Strict Mode Features

JavaScript's Strict Mode is a feature that enforces a stricter parsing and error handling mechanism on your JavaScript code. Activating Strict Mode can be done by adding `'use strict';` at the beginning of a script or a function block. This mode intentionally has different semantics from the normal code, aimed at improving code reliability and performance.

### Features of Strict Mode

1. **Mandatory Variable Declarations**: In Strict Mode, every variable must be declared before use. If a script attempts to use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will throw a `ReferenceError`. This requirement helps to avoid the accidental creation of global variables caused by typographical errors.

2. **Disallows the `with` Statement**: The `with` statement is not allowed in Strict Mode because it creates ambiguity about the scope of variables. Its use can lead to significant performance hits and complicates the debugging process, as it modifies the scope chain, making it harder to predict which variables will be affected by a piece of code.

3. **Scoped `eval()` Function**: Any declarations within an `eval()` expression in Strict Mode do not affect the surrounding scope, making `eval()` safer by preventing it from introducing new variables or modifying existing ones in the parent scope.

4. **Secure `this` Keyword Behavior**: In functions that are not called as methods of an object, the value of `this` is `undefined` in Strict Mode. This contrasts with non-strict mode, where `this` defaults to the global object, reducing the risk of inadvertently modifying the global environment.

5. **Prohibits Duplicate Parameter Names**: Functions cannot have multiple parameters with the same name, which eliminates potential errors from duplicated identifiers and enhances code clarity.

6. **Immutable Non-Writable Properties**: In Strict Mode, attempts to assign values to non-writable properties result in a `TypeError`. This feature ensures the immutability of constants and read-only properties, thus preserving data integrity.

7. **Restrictions on Deleting Properties**: Trying to delete non-deletable properties (such as built-in objects or fixed properties) will throw a `TypeError`, protecting important parts of the languageâ€™s core.

8. **No Octal Numeric Literals**: Octal literals and octal escape sequences are not allowed in Strict Mode. This restriction avoids confusion between mistakenly leading zeroes in numbers and octal syntax, making the code more readable and less prone to errors. 
   - Octal literals are those starting with a leading zero, like `010` stands for 8 in decimal. Octal escape sequences are those starting with `\`, like `\141` stands for `'a'`. We can use `u0061` instead of `\141` to represent `'a'`, and `0o10` instead of `010` to represent `8`.

### Conclusion

By enforcing these constraints, Strict Mode significantly aids in the development of more secure, robust, and clean JavaScript code. It prevents common coding errors, reduces accidental global variable creation, clarifies the scope chain, and enforces a cleaner syntax. Adopting Strict Mode can lead to better performance, easier debugging, and a more structured codebase, which are crucial for maintaining large-scale JavaScript applications.

## Write a `curry` function to curry other functions
Currying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions that each take a single argument. Its main benefits include **parameter reuse, delayed execution, early return, and function composition**.

```ts
function curry(fn: Function) {
    return function curried(...args: any[]) {
        if (args.length >= fn.length) {
            return fn.apply(this, args);
        } else {
            return function (...nextArgs: any[]) {
                return curried.apply(this, args.concat(nextArgs));
            };
        }
    };
}

function sum(a: number, b: number, c: number) {
    return a + b + c;
}

const curriedSum = curry(sum);
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6
console.log(curriedSum(1, 2)(3)); // Output: 6
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

## Implement a Deep Copy Function

Creating a deep copy function in JavaScript is crucial when you want to duplicate complex data structures without altering the original data. This function must handle various data types, including Maps, Sets, and objects with circular references. The common approach using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` falls short for these use cases due to its limitations with certain data types and structures.

### Why Not `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`?

Using `JSON.stringify` followed by `JSON.parse` is a quick method to deep copy objects without nested structures or special types. However, this approach has significant limitations:

- **Loses Map and Set data:** When Maps and Sets are passed through this process, they are converted into objects and arrays, respectively, losing their inherent properties and behaviors.
- **Fails with circular references:** If the object contains circular references (objects referencing themselves directly or indirectly), `JSON.stringify` will throw an error, as it cannot serialize cyclic structures.
- **Does not copy special objects correctly:** Certain JavaScript objects like functions, `undefined`, and special objects (e.g., `RegExp`, `Date`) cannot be accurately cloned through this method, resulting in loss of information or incorrect copying.

### Handling Maps, Sets, and Circular References

To address these limitations, a custom deep copy function is required. This function must thoughtfully handle various data structures, including Maps, Sets, and objects with circular references, ensuring an accurate and efficient cloning process. Below is an enhanced TypeScript implementation that covers these cases effectively:

```typescript
function deepCopy(obj: any, map = new WeakMap()): any {
  // Directly return if obj is null or not an object (e.g., primitives and functions)
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') {
    return obj;
  }

  // Use an existing reference from map if obj was already copied (circular reference handling)
  if (map.has(obj)) {
    return map.get(obj);
  }

  let copy;

  // Clone Date objects by creating a new instance with the same time value
  if (obj instanceof Date) {
    copy = new Date(obj.getTime());
  }
  // Clone RegExp objects by creating a new instance with the same pattern and flags
  else if (obj instanceof RegExp) {
    copy = new RegExp(obj.source, obj.flags);
  }
  // Deep copy Map objects by iterating over entries and recursively copying them
  else if (obj instanceof Map) {
    copy = new Map();
    obj.forEach((value, key) => {
      copy.set(key, deepCopy(value, map));
    });
  }
  // Deep copy Set objects by iterating over values and recursively copying them
  else if (obj instanceof Set) {
    copy = new Set();
    obj.forEach(value => {
      copy.add(deepCopy(value, map));
    });
  }
  // Handle Arrays and plain Objects by creating an empty structure and recursively copying properties
  else {
    copy = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};
    map.set(obj, copy); // Track the object copy to handle circular references
    Object.keys(obj).forEach(key => {
      copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key], map);
    });
  }

  return copy;
}
```

### Key Points

- **Circular Reference Handling:** Utilizes a `WeakMap` to keep track of previously copied objects. This prevents infinite loops by reusing the copied reference instead of attempting to copy the object again.
- **Special Object Cloning:** Provides tailored cloning strategies for `Date` and `RegExp` objects, ensuring that their unique properties and behaviors are preserved in the copy.
- **Recursive Deep Copy:** Employs a recursive approach to accurately copy nested structures, including objects, arrays, Maps, and Sets. This ensures that the deep copy function can handle complex and deeply nested data structures effectively.

### Special Object Cloning - `Date` and `RegExp`
`Date` and `RegExp` objects have unique properties and methods that are not enumerable and cannot be copied over by simply iterating over their keys. For instance:
- A `Date` object encapsulates a single moment in time, represented internally as a timestamp (the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch). This value is not directly accessible as an enumerable property that can be copied.
- A `RegExp` object contains a pattern and flags (such as global, multiline, etc.), which are crucial for its operation. These are accessed through properties like source and flags, not directly copyable via key enumeration.

## Understanding `['1', '2', '3'].map(parseInt)` Output
The `parseInt` function converts a string argument to an integer of the specified radix (base). Its signature is `parseInt(string, radix)`, where:
- `string` is the string to be parsed.
- `radix` (optional) specifies the base of the numeral system to be used. It can be between 2 and 36.

If `radix` is 0, unspecified, or derived from the string's prefix (e.g., `0x` for hexadecimals), `parseInt` will attempt to guess the radix:

- Hexadecimal (base 16) if the string starts with "0x" or "0X".
- Decimal (base 10) for all other cases.

However, to avoid confusion and ensure consistent results, it's recommended always to specify the radix.

### Examples of `parseInt` Usage:

```typescript
parseInt('11', 2); // Returns 3. ('11' in binary equals 3 in decimal)
parseInt('3', 2); // Returns NaN. ('3' is not a valid binary number)
parseInt('A', 16); // Returns 10. ('A' in hexadecimal equals 10 in decimal)
parseInt('0x2F'); // Returns 47. Implicitly detects hexadecimal.
parseInt('1', 0); // Returns 1. (0 or unspecified radix defaults to base 10)
```

### Why `['1', '2', '3'].map(parseInt)` Returns `[1, NaN, NaN]`

When using `map` with `parseInt`, each element of the array is passed to `parseInt` along with its index. The `map` method calls the callback with three arguments: the current element, its index, and the entire array. In the case of `parseInt`, this means the second argument (the index) is used as the radix.

Breaking it down:

- `parseInt('1', 0)`: The radix is `0`, so `parseInt` treats it as base 10. The result is `1`.
- `parseInt('2', 1)`: The radix is `1`, which is not a valid radix, leading to `NaN`.
- `parseInt('3', 2)`: The radix is `2` (binary), and since '3' is not a valid binary digit, the result is `NaN`.

```typescript
const arr = ['1', '2', '3'];
const res = arr.map((item, index) => {
    // For '1', index is 0: parseInt('1', 0) => 1, since 0 is treated as base 10.
    // For '2', index is 1: parseInt('2', 1) => NaN, since 1 is not a valid radix.
    // For '3', index is 2: parseInt('3', 2) => NaN, since '3' is not a valid binary digit.
    return parseInt(item, index);
});
```

## Writing a `getType` Function in JavaScript
The `typeof` operator, `instanceof` keyword, and `Object.prototype.toString.call()` method are commonly used techniques to identify variable types. e.g. `typeof 1` returns `'number'`, `typeof 'test'` returns `'string'`, and `typeof [1, 2, 3]` returns `'object'`. 

However, `typeof` has limitations, especially for reference types, where it returns `'object'` for arrays, null, and objects. To address this, the `Object.prototype.toString.call()` method provides a more detailed type check for reference types.

```ts
function getType(val: any): string {
    const type = typeof val;
    if (type !== 'object') {
        return type; // Returns 'number', 'string', 'boolean', etc.
    }
    // For objects, including arrays and null, use Object.prototype.toString
    return Object.prototype.toString.call(val).slice(8, -1).toLowerCase();
}
```

## Understanding JavaScript Proxies for State Monitoring

JavaScript `Proxy` is a versatile feature that enables the creation of a proxy for another object. This proxy allows for the interception and customization of operations performed on the original object, including property access, assignment, and enumeration. This capability is especially valuable for tracking changes in objects or arrays in a dynamic manner, enabling actions like logging additions to a list or triggering updates in response to changes.

### The Basics of Proxy

A `Proxy` in JavaScript acts as a sophisticated wrapper for an original object, granting fine-grained control over interactions with that object. Operations on the proxy can be intercepted to implement custom behaviors for fundamental operations such as property reads or writes.

### Practical Example: Monitoring List Additions

To demonstrate the utility of a `Proxy`, consider a use case where it's necessary to monitor additions to a list (an array) and perform actions like logging these additions, validating the new items, or updating the UI. A `Proxy` facilitates these tasks by allowing for custom handlers for get and set operations.

**Example Implementation**

The following example showcases the use of a `Proxy` to observe and react to new items being added to a list:

```javascript
// Handler object with traps for get and set operations
let handler = {
  // Trap for property access
  get(target, property, receiver) {
    console.log(`Accessing property '${property}'`);
    return Reflect.get(...arguments); // Uses Reflect API for default operations
  },
  // Trap for property assignment
  set(target, property, value, receiver) {
    console.log(`Adding '${value}' to the list`);
    target[property] = value; // Updates the target list
    // Here, additional actions can be implemented, such as validation or UI updates
    return true; // Indicates that the operation was successful
  }
};

// The original list to be monitored
let originalList = [];

// Creating the proxy for the original list
let proxyList = new Proxy(originalList, handler);

// Performing operations on the proxy list
proxyList.push('Apple');  // Output: Adding 'Apple' to the list
proxyList.push('Banana'); // Output: Adding 'Banana' to the list
```

In this enhanced example, interactions with the `proxyList` trigger the appropriate handler within the `handler` object. Adding a new item to the list via the `push` method activates the `set` trap, which logs the operation and facilitates additional actions like validations or UI adjustments.

### Advantages of Using Proxies

- **Interception and Customization**: Proxies offer a powerful means to intercept and tailor the behavior of fundamental operations on objects, enabling the implementation of custom behaviors and checks.
- **Programmatic Validation**: They provide a mechanism for enforcing programmatic validation rules and constraints on object properties, enhancing data integrity and application robustness.
- **Change Detection**: Proxies are instrumental in detecting changes to objects and arrays, supporting reactive programming patterns by facilitating dynamic responses to data modifications.

## Implement `LazyMan` Class

The `LazyMan` class simulates a sequence of actions for an individual, incorporating actions such as eating or sleeping. Allows for the chaining of `eat` and `sleep` methods, improving code readability and flow. Utilizes JavaScript's event loop to introduce a delay with the `sleep` method before continuing to the next action, demonstrating asynchronous behavior.

```typescript
class LazyMan {
    private taskList: Array<Function>; // Holds a queue of tasks (actions) to be executed.
    private name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.taskList = [];
        setTimeout(() => { // Initiates task execution asynchronously.
            this.next();
        }, 0);
    }

    eat(food: string) {
        this.taskList.push(() => { // Queues an eating action.
            console.log(`eat ${food}`);
            this.next(); // Proceeds to the next queued action.
        });
        return this; // Facilitates method chaining by returning the LazyMan instance.
    }

    sleep(time: number) {
        this.taskList.push(() => { // Queues a sleeping action with a delay.
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log(`wake up after ${time}`);
                this.next(); // Continues to the next action after the delay.
            }, time);
        });
        return this; // Allows for continued chaining.
    }

    next() {
        const fn = this.taskList.shift(); // Dequeues the next action.
        fn && fn(); // Executes the action if it exists.
    }
}

const me = new LazyMan('ronron');
me.eat('apple').sleep(1000).eat('banana').sleep(1000).eat('pear');
```
- **Chainable Methods**: Achieved by returning the instance itself (`this`) from each method, allowing for a fluent interface where methods can be called sequentially on the same object.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Demonstrates the use of JavaScript's `setTimeout` to introduce execution delays, simulating sleep and showcasing asynchronous programming principles. The setTimeout in constructor initiates the asynchronous execution of the first task in the taskList, allowing for a delayed start of the queued actions.The first `this.next` actually starts when the synchronous code finishes, i.e. at `me.eat('apple').sleep(1000).eat('banana').sleep(1000).eat('pear');` line.

## Implementing a Custom EventBus

An **EventBus** is a design pattern that enhances loose coupling among components within software applications. This pattern allows components to communicate with each other without having direct dependencies or knowledge about each other, thereby promoting modularity and ease of integration.

### Methods
The EventBus pattern is implemented through several methods that manage the lifecycle of events and their listeners:

- **on(event: string, listener: Function)**: Registers a listener to an event. The listener can be triggered multiple times for as long as it remains bound to the event. It remains active until it is explicitly removed with the `off` method.

- **once(event: string, listener: Function)**: Similar to `on`, but the listener is designed to be triggered only once. After it is triggered, the listener is automatically removed. It can also be manually removed before it is triggered by using the `off` method.

- **emit(event: string, ...args: any[])**: Triggers all listeners bound to a specific event, passing along any arguments to the listeners.

- **off(event: string, listener: Function)**: Removes a specific listener from an event. This is crucial for managing the lifecycle of listeners and can be used for listeners registered with both `on` and `once`.

### Data Structure
Internally, the EventBus class uses a `Record<string, Function[]>` to maintain a map between event names and arrays of listener functions. This data structure ensures a systematic and type-safe way to manage event-listener relationships.

### Implementation in TypeScript
```typescript
class EventBus {
    private events: Record<string, Function[]>; // Stores event-to-listener mappings

    constructor() {
        this.events = {};
    }

    // Registers a listener for an event for multiple triggers
    on(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        if (!this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event] = [];
        }
        this.events[event].push(listener);
    }

    // Registers a listener for a single trigger on an event
    once(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        const onceListener = (...args: any[]) => {
            listener(...args); // Trigger the original listener
            this.off(event, onceListener); // Automatically remove after execution
        };
        this.on(event, onceListener); // Use `on` to bind the wrapper listener
    }

    // Triggers all listeners for an event, passing additional arguments
    emit(event: string, ...args: any[]): void {
        if (this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event].forEach(listener => listener(...args));
        }
    }

    // Removes a listener from an event
    off(event: string, listener: Function): void {
        if (this.events[event]) {
            this.events[event] = this.events[event].filter(l => l !== listener);
        }
    }
}

const eventBus = new EventBus();

// Bind the 'click' event
eventBus.on('click', () => console.log('clicked'));

// Bind the 'hover' event for a single-time execution
eventBus.once('hover', () => console.log('hovered'));

// Emit the 'click' event
eventBus.emit('click'); // Output: clicked

// Emit the 'hover' event
eventBus.emit('hover'); // Output: hovered
// Trying to emit 'hover' again will result in no output, as the once-bound listener is removed after execution

// Unbind the 'click' event
const clickListener = () => console.log('clicked');
// Note: This demonstrates the concept, but to successfully unbind, the original function reference must be used
eventBus.off('click', clickListener);
eventBus.emit('click'); // There will be no output if the exact function reference was used for both binding and unbinding
```

## Implementing the Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache Algorithm in JavaScript

The Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache Algorithm is a sophisticated caching mechanism designed to optimize memory usage in applications. It achieves this by maintaining a collection of the most recently accessed items and discarding the least recently used items once the cache reaches its specified capacity. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where memory resources are limited and access patterns are highly variable. At the heart of an LRU Cache are two essential methods: `get` and `put`. 

The `get(key)` method retrieve the value associated with a specific key. Its behavior is twofold:
- **Found Key:** If the key exists in the cache, `get` returns its value. Additionally, it updates the cache to mark the key as recently accessed, effectively moving its associated value to the "end" of the cache, which symbolizes its recent use.
- **Missing Key:** If the key is not present in the cache, `get` returns `-1`, indicating that no value is associated with the key in the cache.

The `put(key, value)` method is responsible for inserting or updating key-value pairs in the cache. Its operation is guided by the following principles:
- **Existing Key:** If the key is already present in the cache, its value is updated, and its position is adjusted to reflect its recent use.
- **New Key with Full Cache:** If the key is new and the cache has reached its maximum capacity, the least recently used item is evicted to accommodate the new key-value pair. This ensures that the cache does not exceed its size limit while prioritizing the retention of recently accessed items.

Leveraging JavaScript's `Map` object, which naturally maintains the order of its elements based on insertion, we can efficiently implement an LRU Cache. The `Map` object's inherent ordering is utilized to track the recency of access for the cache's key-value pairs.

```typescript
class LRUCache {
    private capacity: number;
    private cache: Map<number, number>;

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity; // Define the maximum size of the cache
        this.cache = new Map(); // Utilize a Map for its order-preserving properties
    }

    get(key: number): number {
        if (this.cache.has(key)) {
            const value = this.cache.get(key);
            this.cache.delete(key); // Remove the key to update its position
            this.cache.set(key, value); // Re-insert the key to mark it as recently used
            return value;
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        if (this.cache.has(key)) {
            this.cache.delete(key); // Prepare to update the key's position
        } else if (this.cache.size >= this.capacity) {
            // Cache is full, remove the least recently used item
            const leastUsedKey = this.cache.keys().next().value;
            this.cache.delete(leastUsedKey);
        }
        this.cache.set(key, value); // Insert or update the key-value pair
    }
}

const lruCache = new LRUCache(2); // Initialize a new LRU Cache with a capacity of 2

// Inserting key-value pairs
lruCache.put(1, 1); // Inserts (1, 1)
lruCache.put(2, 2); // Inserts (2, 2)

// Accessing stored values
console.log(lruCache.get(1)); // Outputs: 1 (key 1 is found)

// Inserting another key-value pair, causing the least recently used key (2) to be evicted
lruCache.put(3, 3); // Evicts key 2 and inserts (3, 3)

console.log(lruCache.get(2)); // Outputs: -1 (key 2 has been evicted)

// Further operations demonstrate the LRU eviction policy
lruCache.put(4, 4); // Evicts key 1 and inserts (4, 4)
console.log(lruCache.get(1)); // Outputs: -1 (key 1 has been evicted)
console.log(lru

Cache.get(3)); // Outputs: 3 (key 3 is found)
console.log(lruCache.get(4)); // Outputs: 4 (key 4 is found)
```

## Follow-up: Implementing LRU Cache Without Map or Record

Creating an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache in JavaScript without the built-in `Map` or `Record` types involves a more manual approach to managing memory and order of items. This method uses a hash table for quick access and a doubly linked list to efficiently keep track of the items' order, prioritizing the most recently used.

1. **Doubly Linked List:** Each node in the list corresponds to an item in the cache, equipped with pointers to both the preceding and subsequent items. This bidirectional linking enables quick additions, removals, and reordering of nodes based on access patterns, facilitating the LRU policy's requirement of moving recently accessed items to the forefront.

2. **Hash Table:** For the hash table, a simple JavaScript object (`{}`) suffices. The hash table offers constant-time complexity for key-based operations, such as lookups, insertions, and deletions. It stores references to the nodes in the doubly linked list, thereby bridging the gap between quick access and maintaining order.

```typescript
class ListNode {
    key: number;
    value: number;
    prev: ListNode | null = null;
    next: ListNode | null = null;

    constructor(key: number, value: number) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class LRUCache {
    private capacity: number;
    private hashTable: { [key: number]: ListNode };
    private head: ListNode | null;
    private tail: ListNode | null;

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity; // Defines the cache's maximum size
        this.hashTable = {}; // Key-node reference storage
        this.head = this.tail = null; // Initial empty state for the doubly linked list
    }

    get(key: number): number {
        if (!(key in this.hashTable)) {
            return -1; // Key not found scenario
        }
        const node = this.hashTable[key];
        this.moveToHead(node); // Update access order
        return node.value;
    }

    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        if (key in this.hashTable) {
            const node = this.hashTable[key];
            node.value = value;
            this.moveToHead(node); // Refresh position
        } else {
            const newNode = new ListNode(key, value);
            if (Object.keys(this.hashTable).length === this.capacity) {
                this.removeLRUItem(); // Evict least recently used
            }
            this.hashTable[key] = newNode;
            this.addNode(newNode); // Insert at head
        }
    }

    private addNode(node: ListNode): void {
        // Prepends node to the doubly linked list
        node.next = this.head;
        node.prev = null;
        if (this.head) {
            this.head.prev = node;
        }
        this.head = node;
        if (!this.tail) {
            this.tail = node; // First node becomes both head and tail
        }
    }

    private removeNode(node: ListNode): void {
        // Detaches node from its current position in the list
        if (node.prev) {
            node.prev.next = node.next;
        } else {
            this.head = node.next; // Node is head
        }
        if (node.next) {
            node.next.prev = node.prev;
        } else {
