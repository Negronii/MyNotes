## Understanding Promise Execution Order
### Basic Promise Execution Flow
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(0);
  return Promise.resolve(4);
}).then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(1);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(2);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(3);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(5);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(6);
});
```

**Expected Output:** `0 1 2 3 4 5 6`.

**Key Points:**   
- Promises that are resolved invoke their `.then()` callbacks in a sequence.
- The JavaScript event loop facilitates a balanced execution flow across various promise chains, preventing any single promise from monopolizing the event loop's attention.
- When a `.then()` callback generates a new promise, it introduces an additional task in the microtask queue. This ensures that the new promise's resolution is queued following the microtask queue's principles, allowing the ongoing execution to proceed uninterrupted.

### Interleaved Execution with Multiple Promises
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(0);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(1);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(2);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(3);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(4);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(5);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(6);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(7);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(8);
});
```

**Expected Output:** `0 3 6 1 4 7 2 5 8`.

**Explanation:**  
- This example illustrates how the execution of `.then()` callbacks from multiple promises can be interleaved. This approach ensures that asynchronous tasks initiated around the same time advance in a balanced manner.

### Delayed Execution with Nested Promises
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(0);
  return Promise.resolve(1);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(2);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(3);
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log(4);
  return Promise.resolve(5);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(6);
}).then(() => {
  console.log(7);
});
```
**Output:** `0 4 2 6 3 7`.

**Detailed Insights:**  
- When a `.then()` callback returns another promise, it delays the execution order. This delay is twofold: one for the promise to settle and another for its resolution to be queued in the microtask queue.
- This highlights the role of the event loop and microtask queue in managing the execution order of asynchronous operations in JavaScript, demonstrating the intricacies of asynchronous execution timing.

### Simulating Promise Execution Order
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  // First beat
  const p = Promise.resolve(1);
  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    // Second beat
    p.then(res => {
      console.log(res);
    }).then(() => {
      console.log(2);
    });
  });
});
```

This simulation illustrates the complexity of managing asynchronous operations with promises. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the scheduling mechanisms of promises and their resolutions by the JavaScript event loop and microtask queue to effectively control asynchronous code flow.

## What is and when to use `for await...of`
The for await...of statement is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to loop over asynchronous iterablesâ€”objects that you can iterate over asynchronously, such as Promises. It waits until the Promise is resolved before moving to the next iteration, making it useful for handling asynchronous operations in a sequential manner.
```ts
async function processPromises() {
    function createPromise(val) {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve(val);
            }, 1000);
        });
    }

    const p1 = createPromise(100);
    const p2 = createPromise(200);
    const p3 = createPromise(300);
    const list = [p1, p2, p3];

    // Iterating over an array of Promises and logging each resolved value
    // effect is same as:
    // Promise.all(list).then(res => console.log(res))
    for await (let res of list) {
        console.log(res);
    }

    // Performing asynchronous operations in sequence
    const arr = [100, 200, 300];
    for (let num of arr) {
        const res = await createPromise(num); // Ensure this code is inside an async function
        console.log(res);
    }
}

processPromises();
```

The `for await...of` loop is a powerful feature for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, providing a more intuitive and cleaner way to process sequences of Promises compared to chaining or using `Promise.all()`. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain the order of operations or when working with streams of asynchronous data.

`Promise.all()` only make sure the promises are resolved in parallel, or there is an error in any of the promises, but `for await...of` makes sure the promises are resolved in sequence.
