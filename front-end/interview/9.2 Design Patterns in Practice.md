### Design a Data Model and Core Features for an HTML5 Low-Code Development Platform

Creating an effective data model for a low-code development platform involves constructing a robust structure that supports extensive customization, real-time collaboration, and project management. This section outlines the primary components and functionalities that should be considered in the design process.

- **User Interface Design Tools:** Tools should allow users to visually create and adjust UI components. Features might include drag-and-drop interfaces, property inspectors, and responsive design options.
- **Project Management:** Capabilities should include creating new projects, saving ongoing work, publishing finished or interim stages, and managing project versions.
- **Collaboration Features:** The platform should support simultaneous editing by multiple users, conflict resolution strategies, and live updates to facilitate team-based project development.
- **Extensibility:** The system should allow for the integration of third-party or custom-built plugins and components to enhance functionality.

#### Data Model Considerations

To achieve efficient and scalable management of project data and user activities, consider the following:

- **Data Syncing:** Use technologies such as WebSockets for real-time communication and long polling for less frequent updates to ensure that all users see the most current project state without significant delay.
- **Component Selection:** Maintain a detailed registry of each user-selected component, identified by unique IDs. This registry should track changes to component properties over time, aiding in undo/redo features and historical edits.
- **Layer Management:** Implement a system to manage the z-index and stacking of UI components through an organized list or array. This arrangement helps in manipulating layer properties like order, visibility, and nesting.

#### Efficient Component Management

Organizing components and their properties efficiently ensures smoother operation and better performance:

- **Style Management:** Centralize styling information within a `style` object for each component to facilitate the application of themes and visual updates.
- **Layer Representation:** Utilize array indices for managing layer depth to simplify rendering logic and enable quick adjustments to the visual hierarchy.

#### Example Implementation in React

Below is an example of a React context provider setup for managing project state in a low-code development environment:

```jsx
import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';

const ProjectContext = React.createContext();

const ProjectProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [project, setProject] = useState({
        title: "My New Project",
        settings: {
            language: 'EN',
            theme: 'light',
        },
        layout: {
            backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
            fontSize: '14px',
        },
        components: [
            {
                id: 'header',
                name: 'Main Header',
                type: 'text',
                style: {
                    color: '#333',
                    fontSize: '32px',
                },
                attributes: {
                    content: 'Welcome to Your Project',
                },
                children: [],
            },
            {
                id: 'image1',
                name: 'Feature Image',
                type: 'image',
                style: {
                    width: '100%',
                    height: 'auto',
                },
                attributes: {
                    src: 'url/to/your/image.jpg',
                    alt: 'Descriptive Image Alt Text',
                },
            }
        ],
        selectedComponentId: null,
    });

    const handleComponentSelect = (componentId) => {
        setProject(prevProject => ({ ...prevProject, selectedComponentId: componentId }));
    };

    return (
        <ProjectContext.Provider value={{ project, setProject, handleComponentSelect }}>
            {children}
        </ProjectContext.Provider>
    );
};

const App = () => {
    const { project, handleComponentSelect } = useContext(ProjectContext);

    const renderComponent = (component) => (
        <div style={component.style} onClick={() => handleComponentSelect(component.id)}>
            {component.type === 'text' ? component.attributes.content : (
                <img src={component.attributes.src} alt={component.attributes.alt} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
            )}
        </div>
    );

    return (
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: project.layout.backgroundColor }}>
            <h1 style={{ fontSize: project.layout.fontSize }}>{project.title}</h1>
            {project.components.map(renderComponent)}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Design a "User - Role - Permission" System

Implementing a User - Role - Permission system effectively manages access within software, such as a blog management system. This is typically structured using the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, a proven approach for handling large-scale permission management due to its scalability and maintainability.

RBAC helps simplify the assignment and management of access rights within a system by linking permissions to roles, and roles to users. This model is adaptable, making it easier to implement changes to access policies and manage user permissions with minimal disruption.

#### User Types and Permissions

A blog management system may feature several types of users, each with unique permissions:

- **Normal User**: Capable of reading, auditing, and hiding blog posts.
- **Admin User**: Inherits all permissions of a normal user, and can additionally update and delete blog posts.
- **Super Admin**: Inherits all permissions of an admin user, with further capabilities to manage user accounts, assign roles, and modify user roles and permissions.

#### Data Models

Key entities in the RBAC system include:

##### User
- `id`: A unique identifier for each user.
- `user_name`: A username for logging in.
- `hashed_password`: A securely encrypted password.
- `comment`: An optional field for notes or additional information about the user.

##### Role
- `id`: A unique identifier for each role.
- `role_name`: The name of the role, indicative of its associated permissions.

##### Permission
- `permission_id`: A unique identifier for each permission.
- `permission_name`: A description of the action that the permission allows.

#### Relationships

Effective management of relationships is crucial in an RBAC system to maintain data integrity and system security.

##### User_Role
- `user_id`: Connects to a specific user.
- `role_id[]`: An array of role identifiers, enabling a many-to-many relationship between users and roles.

##### Role_Permission
- `role_id`: Connects to a specific role.
- `permission_id[]`: An array of permission identifiers, allowing a role to be associated with multiple permissions.

#### Functional Modules

The system should be divided into manageable modules to enhance maintainability and scalability:

- **User Management**: Handles creating, deleting, modifying users, and assigning roles.
- **Role Management**: Manages creating, deleting, and modifying roles, as well as assigning permissions.
- **Permission Management**: Responsible for creating, deleting, and modifying permissions.

#### Design Principles

- **Clarity**: Components should be distinct and understandable to both developers and end-users.
- **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to modify and update.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate growth in users, roles, and permissions without degradation in performance.
- **Standards Adherence**: Follow established best practices and standards, utilizing existing solutions before developing new methodologies.

### Design a HTML5 prize draw page, what are the backend api you need to implement?
Thinking process:  
1. think about the user flow, business logic process, different stages of the process
2. think about the api you need to implement in each step

#### User Flow and Business Logic

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: This is the starting point for user interaction on the prize draw page. Users need to log in or register to participate.
2. **Prize Draw Participation**: The system checks if the user has already participated in the draw. If not, the user can proceed to draw a prize.
3. **Result Handling and Information Submission**: After drawing, the user can see the results and must submit additional information (e.g., shipping address) if they win.
4. **Post-Draw Interactions**: Users can check the status of their prize, view previous draws, and get details about the prizes they've won.

#### Backend API Requirements

To support the user flow and business logic detailed above, a robust set of backend APIs will need to be developed:

1. **User API**: Register a new user. Authenticate a user. Retrieve user profile information. Update user profile information.

2. **Draw Prize API**: Perform a prize draw. Retrieve the current status of a draw. Fetch the result of the last prize draw.

3. **Prize API**: List all available prizes. Get details about a specific prize. Retrieve the user's prize draw history. Update information about a prize (admin restricted).

4. **Statistics API**: Obtain general statistics about page visits, user participation in draws, and shares.

5. **Share API**: Log a user's action of sharing the page to social media.

### Factory Pattern
The Factory pattern involves using a factory function to create instances, effectively hiding the `new` keyword to encapsulate the creation process. This pattern is useful for scenarios where the creation process is complex or when there needs to be some control over how instances are created. Examples include the jQuery `$` function and React's `createElement` function.

**Example**:
```typescript
class Foo {}

function factory() {
    return new Foo();
}

const f = factory();
```

### Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is particularly useful for cases where a single instance of a class should be used across the system, such as the store in Vuex and Redux or a globally unique dialog/modal. JavaScript makes implementing singletons straightforward because there's no need to worry about multithreading issues that might arise in languages like Java, where thread locking mechanisms might be necessary to prevent multiple instances from being created.

**Example**:
```typescript
class Singleton {
    private static instance: Singleton;
    private constructor() {}
    static getInstance() {
        if (!Singleton.instance) {
            Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return Singleton.instance;
    }
    fn1() {}
    fn2() {}
}

const s = Singleton.getInstance();
s.fn1();
```

### Strategy Model

**Strategy Model** is a behavioral design pattern that allows the definition of a family of algorithms, the encapsulation of each algorithm, and making their instances interchangeable within that family. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to dynamically alter the behavior of an object and want to avoid conditional statements.

Consider a scenario in a software application for a logistics company that calculates shipping costs. Different shipping options (e.g., air, ground, freight) have different cost calculation algorithms. The Strategy pattern allows you to switch between different shipping strategies dynamically depending on the user's choice or other specific conditions.

```javascript
// Basic implementation of the Strategy pattern
class Shipping {
  constructor() {
    this.company = null;
  }

  setStrategy(company) {
    this.company = company;
  }

  calculate(package) {
    return this.company.calculate(package);
  }
}

class UPS {
  calculate(pkg) {
    return `$${pkg.weight * 1.56}`;
  }
}

class USPS {
  calculate(pkg) {
    return `$${pkg.weight * 1.45}`;
  }
}

class Fedex {
  calculate(pkg) {
    return `$${pkg.weight * 1.60}`;
  }
}

const package = { weight: 5 }; // weight in lbs
const shipping = new Shipping();

// Using UPS strategy
shipping.setStrategy(new UPS());
console.log('Shipping cost with UPS:', shipping.calculate(package));  // "Shipping cost with UPS: $7.8"

// Switching to USPS strategy without modifying the Shipping class
shipping.setStrategy(new USPS());
console.log('Shipping cost with USPS:', shipping.calculate(package));  // "Shipping cost with USPS: $7.25"
```

**Benefits and Use Cases**
- **Flexibility**: Allows objects to switch behaviors dynamically.
- **Decoupling**: Strategies can be developed and extended independently from clients that use them.
- **Testability**: Each strategy can be tested independently from the clients and other strategies.

### What's the distinction between the Observer pattern and the Publish-Subscribe pattern?

#### Observer Pattern
In the Observer pattern, the subject (the object being observed) and the observers (the objects that want to be notified of changes in the subject) have direct knowledge of each other. This means there is a direct relationship where the subject holds references to the observers and directly notifies them of any changes. This pattern allows for a straightforward and direct communication line but can lead to higher coupling between the subject and its observers.

##### Characteristics:
- **Direct Communication**: Observers are directly registered with the subject.
- **Coupling**: There is a higher degree of coupling, as the subject and observers are directly aware of each other.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for simpler scenarios where the subject's state change is of interest to specific observers directly related to the subject.

#### Publish-Subscribe Pattern
The Publish-Subscribe pattern, on the other hand, introduces a middle layer known as the "event channel" or "message broker," which decouples the publishers (the sources of events) from the subscribers (the receivers of events). Publishers publish events to the event channel without knowing who the subscribers will be. Similarly, subscribers listen for events through the event channel without knowing who the publishers are. This level of indirection adds flexibility and reduces coupling between components, making the system more scalable and easier to extend.

##### Characteristics:
- **Indirect Communication**: The communication between publishers and subscribers is mediated by an event channel, without direct knowledge of each other.
- **Coupling**: There is lower coupling due to the presence of the event channel as an intermediary.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for more complex scenarios where the event source and event consumers need to remain decoupled for scalability and maintainability reasons.

In summary, the key difference lies in the relationship and communication method between the parties involved: the Observer pattern facilitates direct communication between the subject and its observers, resulting in tighter coupling, whereas the Publish-Subscribe pattern uses an event channel to mediate communication, leading to looser coupling and greater flexibility.
