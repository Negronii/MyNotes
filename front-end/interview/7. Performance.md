## How to diagnose performance issues in a slow HTML5 page?
Start by asking the interviewer whether the issue is related to slow operations or slow loading times to narrow down the problem scope and demonstrate proactive communication skills. Then, check for any errors; if there are errors, start investigating from there. If there are no errors, use Chrome's Performance tools for further investigation.

### Front-end Performance Metrics
- **First Paint (FP):** The time it takes for the browser to render the first pixel to the screen.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** The time it takes for the browser to render the first DOM content.
- **First Meaningful Paint (FMP):** Deprecated. This metric was used to measure the time it takes for the browser to render meaningful content for the first time. It has been replaced by LCP.
- **DOMContentLoaded (DCL):** The time it takes for the DOM to be fully loaded and parsed.
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** The time it takes for the largest content element in the viewport to become visible.
- **Load:** The time it takes for the entire page and all its resources to fully load.

These metrics are arranged in chronological order: FP < FCP < FMP < DCL < LCP < Load.

### Chrome DevTools
- **Performance:** Records page performance data, including CPU, memory, network, rendering, and more. Enabling screenshots captures web page snapshots, and timing indicators can show the metrics mentioned above.
- **Network:** Analyzes network requests, including the resources requested, timeline, size, and more. It also shows an overview of performance metrics when enabled.

### Lighthouse
A popular third-party performance evaluation tool that works on both mobile and desktop. It provides an overall score, including the above metrics, and offers optimization suggestions such as using next-gen image formats (e.g., WebP, AVIF), compressing and correctly sizing images, which can save loading time.

**Example:**
```
npm install -g lighthouse
lighthouse https://www.baidu.com --view --preset=desktop
```

### Web Page Loading Slowly?
- Improve server hardware configurations, use CDN.
- Implement route lazy loading and asynchronously load large components to reduce the main package size.
- Optimize HTTP caching strategies.

### Slow Rendering?
- Optimize backend services (e.g., slow AJAX data fetching).
- Further analyze and optimize the logic within front-end components.
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR).

### Continuous Follow-up
Performance optimization is a gradual process, unlike bug fixes which can often be resolved quickly. Continuously monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimizations progressively. Utilize third-party analytics services such as Alibaba Cloud ARMS, Baidu Analytics, or Google Analytics for ongoing performance tracking.

### Summary
Analyze performance metrics to identify the root causes of slowness, address issues specifically, and continuously improve and optimize for better performance.

## What is debouncing and what is throttling, what are the differences, and name use cases of each

### Debouncing

Debouncing in web development is a strategy used to limit the frequency of execution of a potentially expensive operation that could be triggered repeatedly, such as during window resizing or scrolling. A debounced function will only execute after a specified amount of time has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. For example, if a debounced function is associated with a scrolling event, it will only execute after the user has stopped scrolling for a defined period.

**Throttling**

Throttling is a technique similar to debouncing, but instead of delaying the execution of a function, it ensures the function is executed at regular intervals. For instance, a function triggered by a scroll event, when throttled to execute every 100 milliseconds, will run at most 10 times per second, regardless of the frequency of the scroll event.

**Differences between Debouncing and Throttling**

1. **Timing Control**: Debouncing delays the execution of a function until a specified time has passed since its last invocation. Throttling, however, limits the function's execution to regular, specified intervals.

2. **Use Cases**: Debouncing is useful in scenarios where the function's frequent execution is unnecessary and delays are acceptable, such as in auto-saving or search bar suggestions. Throttling is employed when consistent execution rate is desired, like in handling scroll events or resizing.

3. **Behavior**: In debouncing, the function executes only after the triggering event has ceased for a defined duration. In throttling, the function executes at consistent intervals regardless of the frequency of event triggers.

**Use Cases**

1. **Debouncing**: This is commonly used in search bars, where you want to wait for the user to finish typing before firing an API request, rather than sending requests for every keystroke.

2. **Throttling**: An example is the implementation of infinite scrolling on a website, where you aim to load more content at certain intervals of scrolling, rather than at every small scroll movement.

Both debouncing and throttling are integral for enhancing performance and user experience in web applications. Libraries like **Lodash** offer robust implementations of these techniques.

### Implement debouncing in typescript
```js
function debounce(func, waitFor) {
    let timeout;

    return function(...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            func.apply(this, args);
        }, waitFor);
    };
}

// Example Usage:
const debouncedLog = debounce((message) => console.log(message), 500);

// Usage
debouncedLog("Hello");
debouncedLog("Hello again, quickly"); // This call will cancel the previous one and only this message will be logged after 500ms
```

### Implement a throttling function in JavaScript
```js
function throttle(func, limit) {
    let inThrottle;
    return function() {
        const args = arguments;
        const context = this;
        if (!inThrottle) {
            func.apply(context, args);
            inThrottle = true;
            setTimeout(() => inThrottle = false, limit);
        }
    };
}

// Example usage:
window.addEventListener('resize', throttle(function() {
    console.log('Resize event triggered');
}, 2000));
```

## HTML5 First-Screen Optimization Techniques

### 1. Route Lazy Loading
- **Applicability**: Suitable for Single Page Applications (SPA) but not for Multi-Page Applications (MPA).
- **Concepts**: 
  - **SPA** refers to a web application or site that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. This results in a more fluid user experience similar to a desktop application.
  - **MPA** is a traditional web application approach that reloads the entire page and requests the HTML from the server on each page change.
- **Implementation in React**: Achieved by splitting the route and ensuring priority loading of the homepage. This can be done using React's `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for dynamic imports and lazy loading of components.

### 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - Exemplified by Next.js
- **Explanation**: Traditional SPA renders the page in a complex process, downloading HTML and JavaScript first, then fetching other resources. SSR simplifies this process by serving a fully rendered HTML page directly from the server, improving performance.
- **Benefits**: Ideal for pure HTML5 pages as it offers ultimate performance optimization, albeit at a higher cost.
- **Historical Context**: SSR is not a new technology. It has been used since the HTML1.0 era in technologies like PHP, ASP, and JSP. With the evolution of technology and the separation of front-end and back-end development, it has gained recent attention for enhancing user experience. Nuxt.js (for Vue) and Next.js (for React) are current examples.

### 3. App Prefetch
- **Usage**: When an HTML5 page is displayed within an app WebView, such as opening a page on Facebook.
- **Method**: The app preloads the first screen content of an article when the user visits the list page. Upon entering the HTML5 page, content is retrieved directly from the app using JSBridge, allowing instant display of the first screen.

### 4. Pagination
- **Application**: Specifically for list pages.
- **Strategy**: Only the first page's content is displayed by default. More content is loaded as the user scrolls up, which can be optimized further with throttling to manage load performance.

### 5. Image Lazy Loading
- **Focus**: Primarily for detail pages.
- **Approach**: Text content is displayed by default, followed by images through lazy loading.
- **Note**: Ensure image dimensions are set in advance to reserve space, minimizing layout shifts and reflows.

### 6. Hybrid Approach
- **Method**: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files are pre-downloaded to the app. Pages are loaded using the `file://` protocol within the app's WebView, which is significantly faster as it accesses local files.
- **Content Fetching**: Content is then fetched via AJAX and displayed, potentially in combination with app prefetching for enhanced performance.

## In practical work, how have you optimized React?

### Modify CSS to simulate v-show
Using inline CSS to conditionally display components can be optimized to avoid conditional rendering blocks and improve readability:

```ts
{/* Instead of conditionally rendering the component twice */}
{!flag && <MyComponent style={{display: 'none'}}/>}
{flag && <MyComponent />}

// Use a single line with conditional styling
<MyComponent style={{display: flag ? 'block' : 'none'}} />
```

### Use keys in loops
Using a unique `key` prop in a list helps React identify which items have changed, added, or removed, which can improve the performance of list updates:

```ts
const todoItems = todos.map(todo => 
    // Avoid using the index as a key if the list can change
    <li key={todo.id}>
        {todo.text}
    </li>
)
```

### Use Fragment to reduce DOM depth
React Fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM, which can lead to a more performant and cleaner DOM structure:

```ts
return <>
    <div>1</div>
    <div>2</div>
</>
```

### Do not define functions in JSX
Defining functions directly in JSX can lead to performance issues as the function will be recreated on every render. Instead, define your function outside the JSX return statement:

```ts
// Avoid defining functions directly in the JSX
<button onClick={() => {...}}>Click Me</button>

// Prefer defining your function outside and referencing it in JSX
function MyComponent() {
    const handleClick = () => {...}
    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
}
```

### Bind `this` in the constructor
For class components, it's important to bind `this` in the constructor to ensure that `this` refers to the component instance in your event handlers:

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        // Bind this in the constructor
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
    }
    handleClick() { /* Now `this` refers to the component instance */ }
    
    // Arrow functions automatically bind `this` to the class instance
    handleClick2 = () => { /* Arrow function, no need to bind this */ }
    
    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    }
}
```

### Use shouldComponentUpdate or React.PureComponent
#### `shouldComponentUpdate`

The `shouldComponentUpdate` method is available in class components and allows you to prevent unnecessary re-renders by manually determining whether a component should update in response to changes in props or state. It receives the next props and state as arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether React should continue with the rendering process.

Implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` can significantly improve performance, particularly in cases where you know that the UI does not need to update in response to certain changes.

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Only re-render if the next id is different from the current one
    return nextProps.id !== this.props.id;
  }
  
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.id}</div>;
  }
}
```

In the example above, the component will only re-render if the `id` prop changes. This manual comparison can be very efficient but requires careful implementation to avoid missed updates or stale renders.

#### `React.PureComponent`

`React.PureComponent` is a base class for class components that automatically implements `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow prop and state comparison. When your component extends `React.PureComponent`, React will shallowly compare the old props and state with the new ones and re-render the component only if there was a change.

This is particularly useful for components that have simple props and state structures where a shallow comparison is sufficient to detect changes.

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.id}</div>;
  }
}
```

While `React.PureComponent` reduces the need to manually implement `shouldComponentUpdate`, it's important to remember that it performs a shallow comparison. This means it might not work as expected if your props or state include complex data structures like nested objects or arrays that might change internally without changing their identity.

#### `React.memo`

For functional components, which cannot extend `React.PureComponent` or implement `shouldComponentUpdate`, React provides the `React.memo` higher-order component. Similar to `React.PureComponent`, `React.memo` wraps a functional component and adds a memoization feature, performing a shallow comparison of the component's props. If the props are the same as the previous render, React will skip rendering the component and reuse the last rendered result.

```ts
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.id}</div>;
});
```

`React.memo` is a powerful tool for optimizing functional components, especially when they are expected to render often with the same props. For more complex comparison logic, `React.memo` accepts a second argument, a custom comparison function, giving you control over the comparison logic similar to `shouldComponentUpdate`.

```ts
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Component body
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Return true if passing nextProps to render would return
  // the same result as passing prevProps, false otherwise
  return prevProps.id === nextProps.id;
});
```
