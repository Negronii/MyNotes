### Implementing the Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache Algorithm in JavaScript

The Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache Algorithm is a sophisticated caching mechanism designed to optimize memory usage in applications. It achieves this by maintaining a collection of the most recently accessed items and discarding the least recently used items once the cache reaches its specified capacity. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where memory resources are limited and access patterns are highly variable. At the heart of an LRU Cache are two essential methods: `get` and `put`. 

The `get(key)` method retrieve the value associated with a specific key. Its behavior is twofold:
- **Found Key:** If the key exists in the cache, `get` returns its value. Additionally, it updates the cache to mark the key as recently accessed, effectively moving its associated value to the "end" of the cache, which symbolizes its recent use.
- **Missing Key:** If the key is not present in the cache, `get` returns `-1`, indicating that no value is associated with the key in the cache.

The `put(key, value)` method is responsible for inserting or updating key-value pairs in the cache. Its operation is guided by the following principles:
- **Existing Key:** If the key is already present in the cache, its value is updated, and its position is adjusted to reflect its recent use.
- **New Key with Full Cache:** If the key is new and the cache has reached its maximum capacity, the least recently used item is evicted to accommodate the new key-value pair. This ensures that the cache does not exceed its size limit while prioritizing the retention of recently accessed items.

Leveraging JavaScript's `Map` object, which naturally maintains the order of its elements based on insertion, we can efficiently implement an LRU Cache. The `Map` object's inherent ordering is utilized to track the recency of access for the cache's key-value pairs.

```typescript
class LRUCache {
    private capacity: number;
    private cache: Map<number, number>;

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity; // Define the maximum size of the cache
        this.cache = new Map(); // Utilize a Map for its order-preserving properties
    }

    get(key: number): number {
        if (this.cache.has(key)) {
            const value = this.cache.get(key);
            this.cache.delete(key); // Remove the key to update its position
            this.cache.set(key, value); // Re-insert the key to mark it as recently used
            return value;
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        if (this.cache.has(key)) {
            this.cache.delete(key); // Prepare to update the key's position
        } else if (this.cache.size >= this.capacity) {
            // Cache is full, remove the least recently used item
            const leastUsedKey = this.cache.keys().next().value;
            this.cache.delete(leastUsedKey);
        }
        this.cache.set(key, value); // Insert or update the key-value pair
    }
}

const lruCache = new LRUCache(2); // Initialize a new LRU Cache with a capacity of 2

// Inserting key-value pairs
lruCache.put(1, 1); // Inserts (1, 1)
lruCache.put(2, 2); // Inserts (2, 2)

// Accessing stored values
console.log(lruCache.get(1)); // Outputs: 1 (key 1 is found)

// Inserting another key-value pair, causing the least recently used key (2) to be evicted
lruCache.put(3, 3); // Evicts key 2 and inserts (3, 3)

console.log(lruCache.get(2)); // Outputs: -1 (key 2 has been evicted)

// Further operations demonstrate the LRU eviction policy
lruCache.put(4, 4); // Evicts key 1 and inserts (4, 4)
console.log(lruCache.get(1)); // Outputs: -1 (key 1 has been evicted)
console.log(lru

Cache.get(3)); // Outputs: 3 (key 3 is found)
console.log(lruCache.get(4)); // Outputs: 4 (key 4 is found)
```

### Follow-up: Implementing LRU Cache Without Map or Record

Creating an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache in JavaScript without the built-in `Map` or `Record` types involves a more manual approach to managing memory and order of items. This method uses a hash table for quick access and a doubly linked list to efficiently keep track of the items' order, prioritizing the most recently used.

1. **Doubly Linked List:** Each node in the list corresponds to an item in the cache, equipped with pointers to both the preceding and subsequent items. This bidirectional linking enables quick additions, removals, and reordering of nodes based on access patterns, facilitating the LRU policy's requirement of moving recently accessed items to the forefront.

2. **Hash Table:** For the hash table, a simple JavaScript object (`{}`) suffices. The hash table offers constant-time complexity for key-based operations, such as lookups, insertions, and deletions. It stores references to the nodes in the doubly linked list, thereby bridging the gap between quick access and maintaining order.

```typescript
class ListNode {
    key: number;
    value: number;
    prev: ListNode | null = null;
    next: ListNode | null = null;

    constructor(key: number, value: number) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class LRUCache {
    private capacity: number;
    private hashTable: { [key: number]: ListNode };
    private head: ListNode | null;
    private tail: ListNode | null;

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity; // Defines the cache's maximum size
        this.hashTable = {}; // Key-node reference storage
        this.head = this.tail = null; // Initial empty state for the doubly linked list
    }

    get(key: number): number {
        if (!(key in this.hashTable)) {
            return -1; // Key not found scenario
        }
        const node = this.hashTable[key];
        this.moveToHead(node); // Update access order
        return node.value;
    }

    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        if (key in this.hashTable) {
            const node = this.hashTable[key];
            node.value = value;
            this.moveToHead(node); // Refresh position
        } else {
            const newNode = new ListNode(key, value);
            if (Object.keys(this.hashTable).length === this.capacity) {
                this.removeLRUItem(); // Evict least recently used
            }
            this.hashTable[key] = newNode;
            this.addNode(newNode); // Insert at head
        }
    }

    private addNode(node: ListNode): void {
        // Prepends node to the doubly linked list
        node.next = this.head;
        node.prev = null;
        if (this.head) {
            this.head.prev = node;
        }
        this.head = node;
        if (!this.tail) {
            this.tail = node; // First node becomes both head and tail
        }
    }

    private removeNode(node: ListNode): void {
        // Detaches node from its current position in the list
        if (node.prev) {
            node.prev.next = node.next;
        } else {
            this.head = node.next; // Node is head
        }
        if (node.next) {
            node.next.prev = node.prev;
        } else {
            this.tail = node.prev; // Node is tail
        }
    }

    private moveToHead(node: ListNode): void {
        // Re-positions a node to the head after access
        this.removeNode(node);
        this.addNode(node);
    }

    private removeLRUItem(): void {
        // Evicts the least recently used node from the list's tail
        if (this.tail) {
            delete this.hashTable[this.tail.key]; // Cleanup hash table entry
            this.removeNode(this.tail); // Detach the node
        }
    }
}
```

### How is a Linked List Used in Front-End Development?

In front-end development, traditional linked lists are not commonly used data structures. However, they find a crucial application in a modified form within React's Fiber architecture.

#### React's Fiber Architecture
**Introduction**
React Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core reconciliation algorithm. Its primary goal is to enable incremental renderingâ€”the capability to break down rendering work into manageable chunks that can be paused and resumed.

**Utilizing a Fiber Structure**
React Fiber uses a structure similar to a linked list to manage its component tree. Each component in the tree is a node in this structure (often called a "fiber"), and these nodes are linked to facilitate various operations such as the traversal of the component tree, updating, and rendering.

**Advantages of Fiber Structure**
1. **Incremental Rendering**: The fiber structure allows for tasks to be paused and resumed, improving performance in complex applications by breaking down the rendering process.
2. **Concurrency**: This structure supports the efficient management of UI operations, enhancing responsiveness and user interaction.
3. **Priority-Based Updates**: React can prioritize updates more effectively, optimizing performance in real-time scenarios.

While traditional linked lists are not standard tools in front-end development, React's strategic adaptation of this concept in its Fiber architecture highlights its potential in optimizing rendering processes and managing state in sophisticated web applications.

### implementing a queue using a linked list in TypeScript:
In TypeScript, you can implement a queue using a linked list by maintaining references to both the head and tail of the list. The queue operations work as follows:

Enqueue (Add to Queue): To add an item, you create a new node and attach it to the current tail of the linked list, then update the tail reference to this new node. If the queue is empty, this new node is both the head and tail.

Dequeue (Remove from Queue): To remove an item, you take the value from the head of the linked list and then update the head reference to the next node in the list. If the list becomes empty, update the tail reference to null as well.

This approach ensures that both enqueue and dequeue operations are O(1), providing efficient queue management. Itâ€™s important to handle edge cases, such as dequeueing from an empty queue, to avoid errors.

### Implement a queue in TypeScript, and is a linked list faster or an array?
In TypeScript, implementing a queue can be done using either an array or a linked list. An array-based queue is simple to implement but its dequeue operation (shift) is O(n) due to the need to shift elements. In contrast, a linked list implementation offers O(1) time complexity for both enqueue and dequeue operations, as it allows for constant-time insertions and deletions without reindexing.

So, while both can be used to implement a queue, a linked list is generally faster and more efficient for typical queue operations. This makes linked lists preferable in scenarios where frequent enqueue and dequeue operations are expected, whereas arrays might be more suitable when memory efficiency is a priority and operations are less frequent.

### implement a queue with linkedlist
```ts
interface ILinkedListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ILinkedListNode | null;
}

class Queue {
    // undefined usually used for uninitialized value, null for empty values, here null is better
    private head: ILinkedListNode | null;
    private tail: ILinkedListNode | null;
    private len: number;

    // use constructor instead of set values above, make code more readable
    // Inside class methods, use this to refer to instance variables 
    constructor(){
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
        this.len = 0;
    }

    // for better clarity, mention return type void if return nothing
    offer(val: number): void {
        const temp: ILinkedListNode = {val: val, next: null};
        // in case the queue is empty, use === check value and type
        if (this.head === null) {
            this.head = temp;
            this.tail = temp;
        } 
        // normal case
        else {
            // avoid non-null assertions to avoid legitimate null/undefined errors, i.e. try avoid below commented code
            // this.tail!.next = temp;
            if (this.tail) {
                this.tail.next = temp;
            }
            this.tail = temp;
        }
        this.len += 1;
    }

    poll(): number | null {
        if (this.head === null) {
            return null;
        } 
        if (this.head.next === null) {
            this.tail = null;
        }
        // here use const instead of let, since it never changes
        const temp = this.head.val;
        this.head = this.head.next;
        this.len -= 1;
        return temp;
    }

    // with get keyword, we can use the return value as an attribute, e.g. const queue = new Queue(); const len = queue.size;
    get size(): number {
        return this.len;
    }
}
```

### Queue in JavaScript
```javascript
function Queue() {
  this.elements = [];
}

Queue.prototype.enqueue = function (e) {
  this.elements.push(e);
};

Queue.prototype.dequeue = function () {
  return this.elements.shift();
};

Queue.prototype.isEmpty = function () {
  return this.elements.length === 0;
};

Queue.prototype.peek = function () {
  return !this.isEmpty() ? this.elements[0] : undefined;
};

Queue.prototype.size = function () {
  return this.elements.length;
};

const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(1);
queue.enqueue(2);
queue.enqueue(3);

console.log(queue.dequeue()); // Outputs 1
console.log(queue.peek());    // Outputs 2
console.log(queue.size());    // Outputs 2
console.log(queue.isEmpty()); // Outputs false
```

#### Practical Use in Redux

Queues can be particularly useful in managing state updates in applications using **React Redux**. They help in sequencing state updates and ensuring that they are handled in the order they were initiated.

In React Redux, actions dispatched to update the state of an application might be processed asynchronously. Implementing a queue can help maintain the order of these actions, especially in scenarios with multiple state changes reliant on the order of execution. This ensures a predictable state management flow, which is crucial for maintaining consistency across the application.

#### Benefits of Using Queues
- **Order Preservation**: Ensures actions are processed in the order they were received.
- **Concurrency Management**: Helps in handling multiple state updates efficiently.
- **Predictability**: Increases the predictability of state changes, which is crucial for debugging and maintenance.

### Stack
Stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, commonly used in computing for various tasks such as managing function calls and evaluating expressions. It supports two primary operations: `push` and `pop`. The `push` operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while `pop` removes and returns the top element.

#### Operations
**Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack. 
**Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
**Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
**IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.

```js
function Stack() {
  this.stack = [];
}

Stack.prototype.push = function(value) {
  this.stack.push(value);
}

Stack.prototype.pop = function() {
  return this.stack.pop();
}

Stack.prototype.peek = function() {
  return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
}

Stack.prototype.isEmpty = function() {
  return this.stack.length === 0;
}

const stack = new Stack();
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);
console.log(stack.pop()); // Output: 3
console.log(stack.peek()); // Output: 2
console.log(stack.isEmpty()); // Output: false
```

#### Applications
Stacks are versatile structures used in various programming scenarios:
- **Webpack Loader**: Manages the transformations applied to modules.
- **Browser History**: Tracks the pages visited in a session for backward navigation.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Utilized in traversing graphs or trees where nodes are explored as deep as possible before backtracking.

Each application leverages the LIFO property of the stack to manage data efficiently in scenarios where the last entered item needs to be accessed first.
