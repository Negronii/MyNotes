### Agile Development

#### Overview
Agile development is a software and product development methodology that prioritizes flexibility, iterative progress, and continuous improvement. It promotes the delivery of small, workable segments of a project frequently. This approach allows development teams to respond swiftly and efficiently to changes in project requirements or priorities.

#### Principles
Agile development is based on several core principles:
- **Customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- **Welcoming changing requirements**, even late in development.
- **Delivering working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
- **Daily cooperation** between business people and developers.
- **Supporting and trusting** individuals to get the job done.
- **Face-to-face conversation** as the most efficient and effective method of conveying information.
- **Maintaining a constant pace** indefinitely.
- **Continuous attention** to technical excellence and good design.
- **Simplicity**—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
- **Self-organizing teams** which produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs.
- **Regular reflection** on how to become more effective, then tuning and adjusting behavior accordingly.

#### Benefits
The benefits of Agile development include:
- **Increased flexibility and adaptability** to change.
- **Enhanced product quality** due to frequent testing and revisions.
- **Higher customer satisfaction** through the delivery of products that better meet customer needs and preferences.
- **Improved project predictability** and reduced risks.
