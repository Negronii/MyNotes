### `<script>` Element

The `<script>` element in HTML is used to embed or reference executable JavaScript code within an HTML document. It is a powerful tool for adding dynamic behavior to web pages. Understanding how to use the `<script>` element effectively, including the defer and async attributes, is crucial for optimizing the performance and maintainability of web applications.

#### Basic Usage of `<script>`

1. **Embedding JavaScript:**
   ```html
   <script>
     // JavaScript code here
   </script>
   ```

2. **Referencing an External Script:**
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
   ```

#### `defer` and `async` Attributes

Both `defer` and `async` attributes are used to control how scripts are loaded and executed, especially for scripts that are referenced from external files.

1. **`defer` Attribute:**

   - The `defer` attribute ensures that the script is executed only after the HTML document has been completely parsed.
   - Scripts with the `defer` attribute are executed in the order they appear in the document.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script1.js" defer></script>
     <script src="script2.js" defer></script>
     ```

2. **`async` Attribute:**

   - The `async` attribute allows the script to be executed asynchronously as soon as it is available.
   - Scripts with the `async` attribute are executed as soon as they are downloaded, without waiting for the HTML parsing to complete.
   - The execution order is not guaranteed; scripts may execute in any order.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script1.js" async></script>
     <script src="script2.js" async></script>
     ```

#### When to Use `async` and `defer`

1. **`async`:**
   - Use `async` for scripts that are independent and do not rely on other scripts or the HTML structure.
   - Ideal for analytics scripts, ads, or any script that does not need to manipulate the DOM immediately.

2. **`defer`:**
   - Use `defer` for scripts that need to manipulate the DOM or depend on other scripts.
   - Suitable for scripts that need to maintain order and interact with the document content.

#### Best Practices for `<script>` Element

1. **Load Scripts from Separate Files:**
   - For readability and maintainability, store JavaScript in external files rather than embedding it directly within HTML.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <script src="main.js" defer></script>
     ```

2. **Place Scripts at the Bottom of the Body:**
   - Place `<script>` tags just before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure the HTML is fully loaded before any script runs.
   - Example:
     ```html
     </body>
     <script src="main.js"></script>
     </html>
     ```

3. **Use `defer` or `async` for External Scripts:**
   - Use `defer` for scripts that need to wait until the document is fully parsed.
   - Use `async` for scripts that do not depend on the DOM or other scripts.

4. **Minimize and Compress Scripts:**
   - Minify and compress JavaScript files to reduce their size and improve load times.
   - Use tools like UglifyJS, Terser, or online minification services.

5. **Use Non-Blocking JavaScript:**
   - Avoid blocking the rendering of the page by using `defer` or `async`.
   - Non-blocking scripts improve the user experience by ensuring that the content loads first.

6. **Modularize JavaScript Code:**
   - Break down large scripts into smaller, reusable modules.
   - Use ES6 modules with `type="module"` for better organization and maintainability.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
     ```

7. **Avoid Inline Scripts:**
   - Avoid using inline scripts as they can make the HTML document harder to read and maintain.
   - External scripts enhance security by allowing better Content Security Policy (CSP) management.

#### Example of Best Practices

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is an example page.</p>
    <script src="analytics.js" async></script>
    <script src="main.js" defer></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- `analytics.js` is loaded asynchronously because it does not depend on the DOM.
- `main.js` is deferred to ensure it runs after the document is fully parsed and in the order it appears.

### Implement HTML5 Image Lazy Loading

1. **HTML Markup Setup**: Implement the `loading` attribute in the `<img>` tag to utilize browser-native lazy loading. For older browser compatibility, use `data-src` for the image URL and `src` for a placeholder.

    ```html
    <img src="placeholder.png" data-src="actual_image.png" alt="Descriptive Text" loading="lazy">
    ```

2. **Scroll Event Handling**: Monitor the scroll event to load images as they come into view. Throttle the event to enhance performance by reducing the frequency of execution.

    ```javascript
    window.addEventListener('scroll', _.throttle(() => {
        document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]').forEach(img => {
            if (img.getBoundingClientRect().top < window.innerHeight) {
                img.src = img.dataset.src;
                img.removeAttribute('data-src'); // Prevent reprocessing
            }
        });
    }, 100));
    ```

3. **Initial Image Processing**: On page load, assess and load visible images immediately, catering for content initially within the viewport.

    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        mapImagesAndTryLoad(); // Load visible images at start
    });
    ```

**Optimization Tips**

- **Intersection Observer API**: Use this modern API for a more efficient detection of visible elements, which avoids the overhead of repeated event handling.
- **Throttle vs. Debounce**: Choose between these techniques based on event characteristics and desired responsiveness. Throttling ensures regular execution at fixed intervals, suitable for scroll events, while debouncing delays execution until event activity stops, ideal for resize events.

1. Get Image Position and Window Height
    - Understanding an element's position and the viewport size is essential for tasks like animations, dynamic content loading, and responsive design.
2. Retrieve Element Position
   - **Using `getBoundingClientRect()`**: This method returns an object detailing an element's size and its position relative to the viewport.
       ```javascript
       const elementPosition = document.getElementById('example').getBoundingClientRect();
       ```
3. Determine Viewport Size
   - **Using `window.innerHeight`**: This property gives the height of the layout viewport, useful for sizing and layout adjustments.
       ```javascript
       const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;
       ```

#### Practical Example
```html
<body>
    <!-- Images tagged for lazy loading -->
    <img src="placeholder.png" data-src="actual_image.png" alt="Image Description" loading="lazy">
    <img src="placeholder.png" data-src="actual_image.png" alt="Image Description" loading="lazy">
</body>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.11/lodash.min.js"></script>
<script>
    // Throttled scroll event for lazy loading
    window.addEventListener('scroll', _.throttle(() => {
        mapImagesAndTryLoad();
    }, 100));

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        mapImagesAndTryLoad(); // Immediately load visible images
    });
</script>
```
