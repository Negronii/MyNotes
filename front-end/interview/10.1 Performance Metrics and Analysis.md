### How to diagnose performance issues in a slow HTML5 page?
Start by asking the interviewer whether the issue is related to slow operations or slow loading times to narrow down the problem scope and demonstrate proactive communication skills. Then, check for any errors; if there are errors, start investigating from there. If there are no errors, use Chrome's Performance tools for further investigation.

#### Front-end Performance Metrics
- **First Paint (FP):** The time it takes for the browser to render the first pixel to the screen.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** The time it takes for the browser to render the first DOM content.
- **First Meaningful Paint (FMP):** Deprecated. This metric was used to measure the time it takes for the browser to render meaningful content for the first time. It has been replaced by LCP.
- **DOMContentLoaded (DCL):** The time it takes for the DOM to be fully loaded and parsed.
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** The time it takes for the largest content element in the viewport to become visible.
- **Load:** The time it takes for the entire page and all its resources to fully load.

These metrics are arranged in chronological order: FP < FCP < FMP < DCL < LCP < Load.

#### Chrome DevTools
- **Performance:** Records page performance data, including CPU, memory, network, rendering, and more. Enabling screenshots captures web page snapshots, and timing indicators can show the metrics mentioned above.
- **Network:** Analyzes network requests, including the resources requested, timeline, size, and more. It also shows an overview of performance metrics when enabled.

#### Lighthouse
A popular third-party performance evaluation tool that works on both mobile and desktop. It provides an overall score, including the above metrics, and offers optimization suggestions such as using next-gen image formats (e.g., WebP, AVIF), compressing and correctly sizing images, which can save loading time.

**Example:**
```
npm install -g lighthouse
lighthouse https://www.baidu.com --view --preset=desktop
```

#### Web Page Loading Slowly?
- Improve server hardware configurations, use CDN.
- Implement route lazy loading and asynchronously load large components to reduce the main package size.
- Optimize HTTP caching strategies.

#### Slow Rendering?
- Optimize backend services (e.g., slow AJAX data fetching).
- Further analyze and optimize the logic within front-end components.
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR).

#### Continuous Follow-up
Performance optimization is a gradual process, unlike bug fixes which can often be resolved quickly. Continuously monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimizations progressively. Utilize third-party analytics services such as Alibaba Cloud ARMS, Baidu Analytics, or Google Analytics for ongoing performance tracking.

#### Summary
Analyze performance metrics to identify the root causes of slowness, address issues specifically, and continuously improve and optimize for better performance.
