## How is a linked list used in front-end development?
In front-end development, linked lists aren't commonly used, but a notable example is in React's Fiber architecture. React Fiber uses a linked list to manage the component tree instead of a traditional tree structure. This shift allows React to perform work in chunks and prioritize updates more effectively. The linked list structure enables incremental rendering, where the rendering work can be paused and resumed, improving app performance and user experience. It also facilitates the handling of concurrent operations in the UI, allowing for smoother and more responsive interfaces. Overall, while linked lists are not a standard tool in front-end development, their use in React Fiber demonstrates how they can optimize rendering and state management in complex applications

## implementing a queue using a linked list in TypeScript:
In TypeScript, you can implement a queue using a linked list by maintaining references to both the head and tail of the list. The queue operations work as follows:

Enqueue (Add to Queue): To add an item, you create a new node and attach it to the current tail of the linked list, then update the tail reference to this new node. If the queue is empty, this new node is both the head and tail.

Dequeue (Remove from Queue): To remove an item, you take the value from the head of the linked list and then update the head reference to the next node in the list. If the list becomes empty, update the tail reference to null as well.

This approach ensures that both enqueue and dequeue operations are O(1), providing efficient queue management. Itâ€™s important to handle edge cases, such as dequeueing from an empty queue, to avoid errors.

## Implement a queue in TypeScript, and is a linked list faster or an array?
In TypeScript, implementing a queue can be done using either an array or a linked list. An array-based queue is simple to implement but its dequeue operation (shift) is O(n) due to the need to shift elements. In contrast, a linked list implementation offers O(1) time complexity for both enqueue and dequeue operations, as it allows for constant-time insertions and deletions without reindexing.

So, while both can be used to implement a queue, a linked list is generally faster and more efficient for typical queue operations. This makes linked lists preferable in scenarios where frequent enqueue and dequeue operations are expected, whereas arrays might be more suitable when memory efficiency is a priority and operations are less frequent.

## implement a queue with linkedlist
```ts
interface ILinkedListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ILinkedListNode | null;
}

class Queue {
    // undefined usually used for uninitialized value, null for empty values, here null is better
    private head: ILinkedListNode | null;
    private tail: ILinkedListNode | null;
    private len: number;

    // use constructor instead of set values above, make code more readable
    // Inside class methods, use this to refer to instance variables 
    constructor(){
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
        this.len = 0;
    }

    // for better clarity, mention return type void if return nothing
    offer(val: number): void {
        const temp: ILinkedListNode = {val: val, next: null};
        // in case the queue is empty, use === check value and type
        if (this.head === null) {
            this.head = temp;
            this.tail = temp;
        } 
        // normal case
        else {
            // avoid non-null assertions to avoid legitimate null/undefined errors, i.e. try avoid below commented code
            // this.tail!.next = temp;
            if (this.tail) {
                this.tail.next = temp;
            }
            this.tail = temp;
        }
        this.len += 1;
    }

    poll(): number | null {
        if (this.head === null) {
            return null;
        } 
        if (this.head.next === null) {
            this.tail = null;
        }
        // here use const instead of let, since it never changes
        const temp = this.head.val;
        this.head = this.head.next;
        this.len -= 1;
        return temp;
    }

    // with get keyword, we can use the return value as an attribute, e.g. const queue = new Queue(); const len = queue.size;
    get size(): number {
        return this.len;
    }
}
```

## In-order, pre-order and post-order
In the context of binary trees, in-order, pre-order, and post-order refer to the three primary ways to traverse the nodes of the tree, each with a different order for visiting the nodes.
**In-Order Traversal**: Left, Root, Right.
**Pre-Order Traversal**: Root, Left, Right.
**Post-Order Traversal**: Left, Right, Root.

## find the kth smallest value in a binary search tree
```ts
interface ITreeNode{
    val: number;
    left: ITreeNode | null;
    right: ITreeNode | null;
}

function findKthSmallest(root:ITreeNode, k: number): number | null {
    let count: number = 0;
    let result: number | null = null;

    // this function is in-order
    function dfsHelper(curNode: ITreeNode) {
        if (curNode === null || result !== null) return;

        dfsHelper(curNode.left);

        if (++count === k) {
            result = curNode.val;
            return;
        }

        dfsHelper(curNode.right);
    }

    dfsHelper(root);

    return result;
}
```

## Why binary tree so important, not trinary or quanary tree? 
While arrays provide faster access (O(1)), adding or deleting elements is less efficient (O(N)). Linked lists offer efficient insertion and deletion (O(1)), but slower access times (O(N)).

Compared to arrays and linked lists, binary trees offer a good balance with O(logn) time complexity for access, add, and delete operations when the tree is balanced.

Binary trees, as opposed to ternary or quaternary trees, provide a simpler and more efficient structure for most applications. They strike a balance between maintaining low complexity and achieving efficient operations.

## Why balancing binary tree so important?
An unbalanced binary tree can degenerate into a linked list, leading to O(N) time complexity for operations like add, delete, update, and search. A balanced binary tree, on the other hand, maintains a height of O(logn), ensuring that operations can be performed in logarithmic time. This balance is essential for leveraging the efficiency of binary trees, especially in scenarios where quick search, insertion, and deletion are frequently required.

## Why tree operations has time complexity of O(logn)?
`logn` represents the height of a balanced binary tree. In a balanced tree, each operation like search, insert, or delete involves traversing a path from the root to a leaf node, or vice versa. The number of levels (or height) of the tree determines the maximum number of steps needed for these operations. Since a balanced binary tree is structured to have a height that grows logarithmically with the number of nodes (n), the operations are significantly more efficient than linear time complexity, particularly for large datasets.

## What is a black-red tree? What is B tree? 
- **Red-Black Tree**: It is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node in the tree is colored either red or black. The tree uses these colors along with specific rules to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. The time complexity for balancing a Red-Black Tree during insertions and deletions is O(log n). This balancing act ensures that the tree maintains its O(logn) time complexity for operations. Red-Black Trees are particularly valued for their relatively simple balancing logic and efficient operations, making them suitable for various applications, including implementing associative arrays and priority queues.

- **B-Tree**: A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. Unlike binary trees, B-Trees are multi-way trees (having more than two children) and are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, like databases and filesystems. They are designed to efficiently minimize disk I/O operations, and their branching factor (the number of child nodes) can be adjusted to optimize the balance between the tree's height and the number of nodes accessed per operation.

- **B+ Tree**: A variant of the B-Tree, the B+ Tree, is commonly used in databases and file systems. It maintains data in the leaf nodes, while the internal nodes store only keys for navigation. This design allows for efficient range queries and sequential access, making B+ Trees well-suited for systems that require high-performance data retrieval. See https://blog.csdn.net/Weixiaohuai/article/details/109493541

Both Red-Black Trees and B-Trees are advanced tree structures designed to optimize performance for different scenarios, with Red-Black Trees often used in memory and B-Trees in disk-based storage systems.

## Identify whether a string is prefix of a word in dictionary
A Trie, or a prefix tree, is an optimal data structure for this problem. It stores strings in a tree-like structure, where each node represents a character of a string. The root represents an empty string, and each path from the root to a leaf node represents a word.

To check if a string is a prefix of any word in the dictionary, we insert each word into the Trie. Then, for the given string, we traverse the Trie from the root. If we can traverse the Trie following the characters of the string without any breaks, and reach a node (not necessarily a leaf node), then the string is a valid prefix in the dictionary.

This approach is efficient in terms of time complexity, especially for multiple prefix searches, as each search is only as long as the length of the string being searched.

e.g. word apple may looks like this: {a: {p: {p: {l: {e: null}}}}}

The time complexity for this is O(m) where m is the length of the string

## Depth-First Search (DFS) of a DOM Tree
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a method used to traverse or search a tree or graph data structure. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. When applied to a DOM tree, DFS will visit each node in a manner that deeply explores a node's children before moving to its siblings.

The given TypeScript function `dfs` illustrates how DFS can be applied to a DOM tree. The `visitNode` function is used to log different types of nodes (Comment, Text, HTMLElement). In the `dfs` function, recursion is utilized to visit each node starting from the root, exploring all its child nodes deeply before moving to the next sibling.

```typescript
function visitNode(node: Node) {
    if (node instanceof Comment) {
        console.log('comment', node.textContent);
    }
    if (node instanceof Text) {
        const t = node.textContent.trim();
        if (t) {
            console.log('text', t);
        }
    }
    if (node instanceof HTMLElement) {
        console.log('element', node.tagName);
    }
}

function dfs(node: Node) {
    visitNode(node);
    node.childNodes.forEach((child) => {
        dfs(child);
    });
}
```

### Without Recursion
DFS can be implemented without recursion by using a stack to simulate the call stack of recursion. This approach avoids potential stack overflow errors that may occur with deep recursion. While recursion is more straightforward and readable, using a stack can be more efficient and safer for deep trees.

```typescript
function dfsWithoutRecursion(node: Node) {
    const stack = [node];
    while (stack.length) {
        const n = stack.pop();
        visitNode(n);
        Array.from(n.childNodes).reverse().forEach((child) => {
            stack.push(child);
        });
    }
}
```

## Breadth-First Search (BFS) of a DOM Tree
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another method to traverse or search a tree or graph data structure. Unlike DFS, BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Applied to a DOM tree, BFS will visit each node level by level.

The `bfs` function demonstrates how BFS can be applied to a DOM tree. It uses a queue to visit each node at the current level before moving to the nodes at the next level. This approach ensures that nodes are visited in a breadth-wise manner.

```typescript
function bfs(node: Node) {
    const queue = [node];
    while (queue.length) {
        const n = queue.shift();
        visitNode(n);
        n.childNodes.forEach((child) => {
            queue.push(child);
        });
    }
}
```

### Key Differences Between DFS and BFS
- **DFS** dives as deep as possible into the tree's branches before backtracking, which can be implemented either recursively or using a stack.
- **BFS** visits all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level, using a queue to keep track of the order.

## Array to Tree and Tree to Array Conversion
### TreeNode and ArrayItem Interfaces
```typescript
interface TreeNode {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    children?: TreeNode[];
}

interface ArrayItem {
    id: number;
    parentId: number;
    name: string;
}
```

### Array to Tree Conversion
```typescript
function arrayToTree(arr: ArrayItem[]): TreeNode | null {
    const map = new Map<number, TreeNode>();
    let root: TreeNode | null = null;

    // sort by parentId to ensure parent nodes are processed before children
    arr.sort((a, b) => a.parentId - b.parentId);

    arr.forEach(item => {
        const {id, parentId, name} = item;
        const treeNode: TreeNode = {id, name, children: []};
        map.set(id, treeNode);

        if (parentId === 0) {
            root = treeNode;
        } else {
            const parent = map.get(parentId);
            parent?.children.push(treeNode);
        }
    });

    return root;
}
```

### Tree to Array Conversion
```typescript
function treeToArray(tree: TreeNode): ArrayItem[] {
    const result: ArrayItem[] = [];

    function traverse(node: TreeNode, parentId: number) {
        const {id, name, children} = node;
        result.push({id, parentId, name});
        children?.forEach(child => traverse(child, id));
    }

    traverse(tree, 0);
    return result;
}
```

### Contextual Understanding
- **Relational Databases**: Such as PostgreSQL, typically store data in a tabular format with rows and columns, which resembles the flat array structure. This format is efficient for operations that involve relations between different entities.
  
- **Non-relational Databases**: For instance, MongoDB, often store data in formats akin to the tree structure, like documents in BSON format. This structure is advantageous for storing nested or hierarchical data, such as comments on a post or categories with subcategories.

## What is dynamic programing
- Dynamic programming involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving these down to the simplest base cases. 
- It uses recursion with memoization, or iterative methods with tabulation, to optimize by preventing redundant computations.

## Write a recursive function and a non-recursive return the nth fibonacci number, explain why the recursive one may crash
### Recursive Implementation:
```ts
// method one, recursive
function fibonacci(n: number): number {
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return 1;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}
```
In the recursive Fibonacci function, each function call is added to the call stack, a special region in memory where function call information is stored. When `n` is large, this results in a very deep recursion, where each call to `fibonacci` leads to two more calls, exponentially increasing the number of calls on the stack. This can quickly exceed the memory limit of the stack, leading to a stack overflow error. This happens because the stack has a limited size and cannot accommodate the large number of nested function calls required by the recursive approach for large values of `n`.

- **Time Complexity: O(2^n)**

  Each call to `fibonacciRecursive` generates two more calls, except for the base cases. This exponential growth results in a time complexity of O(2^n), where `n` is the input number.

  e.g. we want to calculate f(8)  
  f(8) = f(7) + f (6), and f(7) = f(6) + f(5)  
  Therefore, F(6) is calculated twice which is redundant computations

- **Space Complexity: O(n)**

  The space complexity is determined by the height of the call stack, which in the worst case (when `n` is large) will have `n` calls stacked on top of each other before reaching the base case. This results in a space complexity of O(n).

### Dynamic Programming Implementation:
```ts
// method 2, dynamic programming
function fibonacci(n: number): number {
    if (n < 0) return -1;
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return 1;
    const dp = [0, 1];
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```
The dynamic programming solution avoids the issue of stack overflow by storing the results of subproblems in an array (`dp`) and reusing them when needed. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it more efficient and suitable for calculating large Fibonacci numbers.

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

  The function iterates from 2 to `n` once, performing a constant amount of work in each iteration. Therefore, the time complexity is linear, O(n).

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

  The iterative solution uses a fixed amount of space (the variables `prevprev`, `prev`, and `result`). This amount of space does not change as `n` increases, making the space complexity constant, O(1).

## A frog, can jump 1 or 2 steps each time. How many ways can i jump a n step stair? 
```ts
function frogJumpDP(n: number): number {
    // only one way to go to step 0 which is doing nothing
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    // the first 1 is for simplicity of calculation so that dp[2] will be 2
    // the second 1 is only one way to go to stair 1
    const dp = [1, 1];
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Follow up: Staircase Variation Problem
Given a staircase with n steps and an array steps[] where each element in the array represents the number of steps the frog can jump at a time, determine the number of ways the frog can reach the top of the staircase. For example, if steps = [1, 3, 5], the frog can jump either 1, 3, or 5 steps in a single jump.
```ts
function frogJumpVariadic(n: number, steps: number[]): number {
    // Array to store the number of ways to reach each step.
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: one way to stay on the ground

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < steps.length; j++) {
            if (i >= steps[j]) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - steps[j]];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
}
```

## 01 Knapsack Problem
In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value. The goal is to determine the maximum value of items that can be packed into a knapsack with a limited carrying capacity. Each item can either be included in its entirety or excluded; partial items are not allowed.

```java
public class Knapsack01 {

    /**
     * Calculates the maximum value that can be packed into the knapsack.
     *
     * @param W the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack
     * @param weights array of item weights
     * @param values array of item values
     * @param n number of items
     * @return the maximum value that fits in the knapsack
     */
    public static int knapsack(int W, int[] weights, int[] values, int n) {
        // dp[w] will hold the maximum value that can be attained with a knapsack capacity of w
        int[] dp = new int[W + 1];

        // Process each item
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Iterate through all capacities from max to the weight of the current item
            for (int w = W; w >= weights[i]; w--) {
                // Update dp[w] to the maximum of itself and the value of taking item i
                dp[w] = Math.max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]);
            }
        }

        return dp[W];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4};
        int[] values = {1500, 2000, 3000};
        int W = 4; // Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack
        int n = weights.length; // Number of items

        int maxVal = knapsack(W, weights, values, n);
        System.out.println("Maximum value that can be packed: " + maxVal);
    }
}
```

#### Key Concepts Explained

- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: The `dp` array is central to the solution, where `dp[w]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a knapsack capacity of `w`.
- **Iteration Order**: It's crucial to iterate the weights in reverse when considering each item, as this ensures that each item is only considered once per capacity.
- **Item Processing**: For each item, we compare the maximum value of not taking the item (`dp[w]`) versus taking the item (`dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]`), thus ensuring that we always store the best solution for every capacity.

## Array Flattening Function in JavaScript
Array flattening is the process of converting a nested array into a single-dimensional array. 

```ts
function arrayFlatten(arr: any[]): any[] {
    let flattenedArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (Array.isArray(arr[i])) {
            flattenedArray = flattenedArray.concat(arrayFlatten(arr[i])); 
        } else {
            flattenedArray.push(arr[i]);
        }
    }
    return flattenedArray;
}

function arrayFlatten(arr: any[]): any[]{
    return arr.reduce((prev, cur) => {
        return prev.concat(Array.isArray(cur) ? arrayFlatten(cur) : cur);
    }, []);
}
```




## Implement binary search and describe time complexity
```ts
// assume input nums is in ascending order, return the index or null if not found
function binarySearch(nums: number[], target: number): number | null {
    let left: number = 0;
    let right: number = nums.length - 1;
    // use <= for case length = 1
    while (left <= right) {
        // Use Math.floor to avoid floating point values for the mid index.
        let mid: number = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        }
        if (nums[mid] > target) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm divides the search interval in half with each step.

## Given an ascending number array and a number n, find 2 numbers in array sum is n. 
```ts
function twoSumsAscending(nums: number[], target: number): number[]{
    let left: number = 0;
    let right: number = nums.length - 1;
    // Use '<' instead of '<=' to prevent the same element from being used twice
    while (left < right) {
        if (nums[left] + nums[right] === target) {
            return [nums[left], nums[right]];
        }
        if (nums[left] + nums[right] < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return [];
}
```

## Move all zeros in an array to its end 
- maintaining the order of the non-zero elements. 
- The operation should be performed in-place
```ts
function moveZeroToEnd(nums: number[]): void {
    let zeroStart: number = -1;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== 0 && zeroStart !== -1) {
            nums[zeroStart] = nums[i];
            nums[i] = 0;
            zeroStart++;
        } else if (nums[i] === 0 && zeroStart === -1) {
            zeroStart = i;
        }
    }
}
```

## Identify the longest sequence of a continuous character in a given string. 
For example, for the string 'aabaacceee', the function should return 'e'.
```ts
interface IRes {
    char: string;
    len: number;
}

function findLongest(s: string): IRes {
    if (s.length === 0) return { char: '', len: 0 }; // Handle empty string

    let longestChar: string = s.charAt(0);
    let longest: number = 1;
    let currentChar: string = s.charAt(0);
    let currentLength: number = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s.charAt(i) === currentChar) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            if (currentLength > longest) {
                longest = currentLength;
                longestChar = currentChar;
            }
            currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            currentLength = 1;
        }
    }

    // Check and update for the last character sequence
    if (currentLength > longest) {
        longest = currentLength;
        longestChar = currentChar;
    }

    return { char: longestChar, len: longest };
}

```

## Implement quicksort in typescript
```ts
function quickSort(nums: number[]): number[] {

- **Average Case (O(n log n))**: In the average case, the pivot divides the array into two roughly equal parts, leading to a logarithmic number of recursive calls (log n). In each level of recursion, the algorithm performs O(n) operations to partition the array around the pivot. Thus, the average case is O(n log n).

- **Worst Case (O(nÂ²))**: The worst case occurs when the pivot is the smallest or largest element in each recursive call, leading to unbalanced partitions. This results in n recursive calls, each doing O(n) work, thus O(nÂ²).

## find palindrome number
Palindrome number, e.g. 1, 2, 22, 101, 10001, 20002, 2002 etc
```ts
function findAllPalindromeNumbers(max: number): number[] {
    const res = []

    for (let i = 0; i <= max; i++) {
        // find reversed number first, then compare
        let reversedNum: number = 0, temp: number = i;
        while (temp !== 0) {
            reversedNum *= 10;
            reversedNum += temp % 10;
            temp = Math.floor(temp / 10);
        }
        if (reversedNum === i) {
            res.push(i);
        }
    }

    return res;
}

function findAllPalindromeNumbers(max: number): number[] {
    const res = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < max; i++) {
        const s = i.toString();
        let start = 0, end = s.length - 1;
        let isPalindrome = true;
        while (start < end) {
            if (s.charAt(start++) !== s.charAt(end--)) {
                isPalindrome = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isPalindrome) res.push(i);
    }

    return res;
}
```


## formatting numbers into a thousand separator style (e.g., "1,000", "12,000,000")
```ts
function format(num: number): string{
    let res: string = "";
    const s: string = num.toString();
    let count: number = 0;
    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (++count === 3 && i !== 0) {
            res = "," + res;
        }
        res = s.charAt(i) + res;
    }
    return res;
}
```

## Switch letter case, e.g. aBc123D -> AbC123d
```ts
function switchLetterCase(s: string): string {
    let res = ""

    // according to ascii table, A-Z is 65-90, a-z is 97-122
    const UPPER_CASE_A = 65;
    const UPPER_CASE_Z = 90;
    const LOWER_CASE_A = 97;
    const LOWER_CASE_Z = 122;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const code = s.charCodeAt(i);
        if (code >= UPPER_CASE_A && code <= UPPER_CASE_Z) {
            // Convert to lower case
            res += String.fromCharCode(code + 32); 
        } else if (code >= LOWER_CASE_A && code <= LOWER_CASE_Z) {
            // Convert to upper case
            res += String.fromCharCode(code - 32); 
        } else {
            // Non-alphabetic characters are unchanged
            res += s.charAt(i); 
        }
    }

    return res
}
```
