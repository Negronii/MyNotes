## Is Virtual DOM (VDOM) fast?

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a core concept in modern web development, particularly in frameworks like React and Vue. It's a lightweight representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in the form of JavaScript objects. While the Virtual DOM was popularized by React, it's now widely used across different front-end frameworks due to its advantages in updating user interfaces.

### Understanding Virtual DOM and Its Performance

The speed of the Virtual DOM depends on the context of comparison. When comparing the direct manipulation of the real DOM (as in libraries like jQuery) to the Virtual DOM approach, direct DOM manipulation can be quicker for simple, isolated operations. This is because it involves a direct interaction with the browser's rendering pipeline. However, this approach can become inefficient and less scalable in complex applications.

The Virtual DOM provides an abstraction layer that allows for a more declarative way of defining UI components and their state changes. Here's how it works:
1. Upon data changes in the application, the UI is re-rendered in the Virtual DOM.
2. A diffing algorithm compares this new Virtual DOM with the previous snapshot to identify the minimal set of changes needed for the real DOM.
3. These changes are batched and applied to the real DOM efficiently, reducing direct manipulation and reflow/repaint costs.

### Advantages of Using Virtual DOM

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React and Vue use a component-based structure, encapsulating UI and business logic into reusable components, which enhances development scalability and manageability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: These frameworks separate the data model from the UI (view), leading to a more predictable data flow and easier state management.
- **Efficiency in Development**: Developers can concentrate on state management and business logic rather than direct DOM manipulations, resulting in more maintainable code and quicker development cycles.

In conclusion, the Virtual DOM is not inherently faster than direct DOM manipulation for every operation. However, it provides a more efficient and effective approach for dynamic web applications, particularly those with complex interfaces and frequent state changes. Its efficiency stems from reducing the amount of direct DOM manipulation, leading to improved performance in applications where state changes are common.

## What is `window.requestIdleCallback`? What's the difference between `requestIdleCallback` and `requestAnimationFrame`?

`window.requestIdleCallback` is a method that allows developers to queue a function to be executed when the browser is idle. This API provides an opportunity to perform background and low-priority work without interfering with critical animations or input response times. It's particularly useful for tasks that aren't time-critical, such as analytics and background data processing.

### React Fiber

React Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It changes the component tree structure to a linked list, enabling incremental rendering. This means that rendering work can be split into chunks and spread out over multiple frames. Fiber's architecture allows React to pause rendering to handle more urgent tasks and then resume when the browser is idle. This is where `requestIdleCallback` becomes relevant; it provides a native way to schedule these low-priority tasks during idle times, enhancing performance without sacrificing user experience.

However, it's important to note that `requestIdleCallback` may have compatibility issues with Safari and Internet Explorer.

### Difference between `requestIdleCallback` and `requestAnimationFrame`

- **`requestAnimationFrame`** is designed for animations and executes just before each repaint, ensuring smooth visual updates. It has a higher priority because maintaining a high frame rate is crucial for animations and user interface responsiveness.
- **`requestIdleCallback`**, on the other hand, is intended for tasks that can wait until the main thread is idle. It runs with lower priority, making it suitable for non-urgent tasks that don't need to be completed immediately.

Both `requestAnimationFrame` and `requestIdleCallback` are considered macro tasks in the JavaScript event loop, but they serve different purposes based on their execution timing and priority levels.

## Difference Algorithm and Implementation in React

### Difference Algorithm
The difference algorithm, often referred to as the "diff" algorithm, plays a crucial role in determining how to update the DOM by comparing two versions of the virtual DOM. Hereâ€™s how it works:
- The algorithm compares components at the same hierarchical level in the virtual DOM tree, avoiding cross-level comparisons.
- If it detects different tags, it will remove the old component and construct a new one instead of delving into further details.
- For child components, the comparison is facilitated by unique "keys," which underscore the significance of assigning keys to list items.

### React's Difference Algorithm
React's diff algorithm employs an efficient strategy known as "right shifting." This means that during a comparison, if elements have only moved backward (to the right) in the list, React will move the elements accordingly instead of recreating them. This approach minimizes unnecessary DOM manipulations, leading to better performance.

### Importance of Keys
Keys are vital for optimizing the rendering process in React. When keys are provided, React uses them to identify which elements have changed, been added, or been removed. This helps in:
- Precisely moving elements in the DOM without having to rebuild them, thus saving time and computational resources.
- Increasing efficiency, especially in dynamic lists where the order of elements might change over time. Without keys, React would have to rebuild the entire list to ensure accuracy, which is far less efficient.

## In practical work, how have you optimized React?

### Modify CSS to simulate v-show
Using inline CSS to conditionally display components can be optimized to avoid conditional rendering blocks and improve readability:

```ts
{/* Instead of conditionally rendering the component twice */}
{!flag && <MyComponent style={{display: 'none'}}/>}
{flag && <MyComponent />}

// Use a single line with conditional styling
<MyComponent style={{display: flag ? 'block' : 'none'}} />
```

### Use keys in loops
Using a unique `key` prop in a list helps React identify which items have changed, added, or removed, which can improve the performance of list updates:

```ts
const todoItems = todos.map(todo => 
    // Avoid using the index as a key if the list can change
    <li key={todo.id}>
        {todo.text}
    </li>
)
```

### Use Fragment to reduce DOM depth
React Fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM, which can lead to a more performant and cleaner DOM structure:

```ts
return <>
    <div>1</div>
    <div>2</div>
</>
```

### Do not define functions in JSX
Defining functions directly in JSX can lead to performance issues as the function will be recreated on every render. Instead, define your function outside the JSX return statement:

```ts
// Avoid defining functions directly in the JSX
<button onClick={() => {...}}>Click Me</button>

// Prefer defining your function outside and referencing it in JSX
function MyComponent() {
    const handleClick = () => {...}
    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
}
```

### Bind `this` in the constructor
For class components, it's important to bind `this` in the constructor to ensure that `this` refers to the component instance in your event handlers:

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        // Bind this in the constructor
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
    }
    handleClick() { /* Now `this` refers to the component instance */ }
    
    // Arrow functions automatically bind `this` to the class instance
    handleClick2 = () => { /* Arrow function, no need to bind this */ }
    
    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    }
}
```

### Use shouldComponentUpdate or React.PureComponent
#### `shouldComponentUpdate`

The `shouldComponentUpdate` method is available in class components and allows you to prevent unnecessary re-renders by manually determining whether a component should update in response to changes in props or state. It receives the next props and state as arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether React should continue with the rendering process.

Implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` can significantly improve performance, particularly in cases where you know that the UI does not need to update in response to certain changes.

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Only re-render if the next id is different from the current one
    return nextProps.id !== this.props.id;
  }
  
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.id}</div>;
  }
}
```

In the example above, the component will only re-render if the `id` prop changes. This manual comparison can be very efficient but requires careful implementation to avoid missed updates or stale renders.

#### `React.PureComponent`

`React.PureComponent` is a base class for class components that automatically implements `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow prop and state comparison. When your component extends `React.PureComponent`, React will shallowly compare the old props and state with the new ones and re-render the component only if there was a change.

This is particularly useful for components that have simple props and state structures where a shallow comparison is sufficient to detect changes.

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.id}</div>;
  }
}
```

While `React.PureComponent` reduces the need to manually implement `shouldComponentUpdate`, it's important to remember that it performs a shallow comparison. This means it might not work as expected if your props or state include complex data structures like nested objects or arrays that might change internally without changing their identity.

#### `React.memo`

For functional components, which cannot extend `React.PureComponent` or implement `shouldComponentUpdate`, React provides the `React.memo` higher-order component. Similar to `React.PureComponent`, `React.memo` wraps a functional component and adds a memoization feature, performing a shallow comparison of the component's props. If the props are the same as the previous render, React will skip rendering the component and reuse the last rendered result.

```ts
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.id}</div>;
});
```

`React.memo` is a powerful tool for optimizing functional components, especially when they are expected to render often with the same props. For more complex comparison logic, `React.memo` accepts a second argument, a custom comparison function, giving you control over the comparison logic similar to `shouldComponentUpdate`.

```ts
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Component body
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Return true if passing nextProps to render would return
  // the same result as passing prevProps, false otherwise
  return prevProps.id === nextProps.id;
});
```

## Common Pitfalls Encountered When Using React

### Naming Conventions for Custom Components
- Custom component names must start with an uppercase letter to differentiate them from native HTML tags. For example, `<Input/>` is a custom component, while `<input/>` refers to the standard HTML input element.

### Wrapping Variables with Braces Inside JSX
- Variables inside JSX should be wrapped in curly braces `{}`. For instance, `<Input value={value} />` correctly binds the `value` variable to the `Input` component's `value` property.

### Asynchronous `setState`
- The `setState` function updates the component state asynchronously. This means you should not expect the state to reflect the new value immediately after calling `setState`. For synchronous logic post-state update, use `setState`'s callback function.

## Unified Error Handling in React

### ErrorBoundary Component
- The `ErrorBoundary` component is used to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
- It only catches errors in the rendering phase, meaning it does not catch errors in event handlers or asynchronous code.
- It works in production environments, but in development, React still displays errors in the UI for better debugging experience.

#### Code Example

```typescript
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state to render fallback UI on next render
    console.info('getDerivedStateFromError', error);
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // Log the error for further analysis
    console.error('componentDidCatch', error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Display fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    // Render children components if no error
    return this.props.children; 
  }
}
```

### Handling Errors Outside of ErrorBoundary

#### Event Errors
- `ErrorBoundary` does not catch errors from DOM events such as `onClick`. You can use `window.onerror` for global error handling or `try...catch` blocks within event handlers.

#### Asynchronous Errors
- `ErrorBoundary` does not catch errors in asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`. Similar to event errors, use `window.onerror` or specific error handling logic in your asynchronous code.

#### Extension: Unhandled Promise Rejections
- Use the `window.onunhandledrejection` event to listen for unhandled promise rejections, providing an opportunity to handle these and prevent the application from crashing.

### Error Reporting and Monitoring
- Implementing error reporting and monitoring (also known as error tracking or logging) is crucial for understanding and improving the stability of a React application. This involves capturing errors, logging them to a server, and analyzing them to fix bugs or improve application UX.

## React Lifecycle
The React component lifecycle refers to the series of events that occur from the moment a component is initially rendered until it is finally destroyed. Understanding these lifecycle events is crucial for creating efficient and effective React applications. The lifecycle can be divided into three main phases:

### Mounting
Mounting is the phase in which a React component is being inserted into the DOM (Document Object Model). It encompasses the following lifecycle methods:
- `constructor()`: This method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated. It's commonly used to initialize state or bind event handlers.
- `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: This method is called right before rendering the component in both the mounting and the updating phase. It's used to update the state based on changes in props over time.
- `render()`: The render method is the only required method in a class component. It examines `this.props` and `this.state` and returns one of the following types: React elements, Arrays and fragments, Portals, String and numbers, Booleans or null.
- `componentDidMount()`: This method is called after the component is mounted to the DOM. It's used for DOM manipulation, fetching data from a remote endpoint, and setting up subscriptions (e.g., listeners).

### Updating
The updating phase occurs when a component's state or props change, leading to a re-render of the component. This phase includes several key lifecycle methods:
- `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: As in the mounting phase, this method is called before the render method and is used to update the state based on changes in props.
- `shouldComponentUpdate()`: This method allows you to decide whether or not React should continue with the rendering process. By returning `true` or `false`, you can optimize component performance.
- `render()`: The render method is called again to re-render the UI based on the new props or state.
- `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`: This method is called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM. It can return a value that will be passed to `componentDidUpdate()`.
- `componentDidUpdate()`: Called after the update has been rendered and reflected in the DOM. It's used for DOM updates, fetching new data, and re-setup of subscriptions if needed.

### Unmounting
The unmounting phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM. It includes one main lifecycle method:
- `componentWillUnmount()`: This method is called right before a component is destroyed and removed from the DOM. It's used to perform any necessary cleanup, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions made in `componentDidMount()`.
