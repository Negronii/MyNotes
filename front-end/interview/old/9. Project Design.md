## Designing a Front-End Analytics SDK

A Front-End Analytics Software Development Kit (SDK) is essential for collecting, analyzing, and reporting user behavior data on websites. This includes data such as page views (PV), click events, custom events (e.g., subscriptions to a VIP service, cancellations of a VIP service), performance metrics, and error logging. Large companies often develop their own analytics solutions, while small to medium-sized enterprises might opt for third-party services like Google Analytics.

The SDK serves as a bridge between the client-side environment and the analytics server, enabling a cyclical process: The SDK collects data from the user's interactions with the website, sends this data to the analytics server, and then the server processes and analyzes the data to generate reports. These insights can then be used to optimize the website, creating a feedback loop that enhances user experience.

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Page Views (PV):** Measure the number of times a page is loaded or reloaded in a browser.
2. **Custom Events:** Track specific user actions such as becoming a VIP member or cancelling a VIP membership.
3. **Performance Metrics:** Monitor the performance of the website, including loading times and interaction delays.
4. **Error Logging:** Capture JavaScript errors and promise rejections to identify issues affecting user experience.

### SDK Design Overview

```javascript
class AnalyticsSDK {
  constructor(productId) {
    this.productId = productId;
    this.initPerformanceTracking();
    this.initErrorTracking();
  }

  // Use private methods for internal functionality in TypeScript
  send(url, params = {}) {
    params.productId = this.productId;
    const queryString = Object.entries(params)
      .map(([key, value]) => `${encodeURIComponent(key)}=${encodeURIComponent(value)}`)
      .join('&');
    const fullUrl = `${url}?${queryString}`;
    // Use a beacon or an image to send data to overcome CORS issues, no need for response handling, and better compatibility
    navigator.sendBeacon ? navigator.sendBeacon(fullUrl) : this.fallbackSend(fullUrl);
  }

  initPerformanceTracking() {
    window.addEventListener('load', () => {
      const performanceData = performance.timing.toJSON ? performance.timing.toJSON() : performance.timing;
      this.send('https://analytics.example.com/performance', { data: JSON.stringify(performanceData) });
    });
  }

  initErrorTracking() {
    window.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
      this.sendError(event.message, event.filename, event.lineno, event.colno);
    });
    window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', (event) => {
      this.sendError('Unhandled Promise Rejection', event.reason);
    });
  }

  sendError(message, source = '', lineno = 0, colno = 0) {
    this.send('https://analytics.example.com/error', { message, source, lineno, colno });
  }

  trackPageView() {
    // Implement logic to avoid duplicate tracking on single-page applications
    this.send('https://analytics.example.com/pv', { url: window.location.href });
  }

  trackEvent(eventName, value) {
    this.send('https://analytics.example.com/event', { eventName, value });
  }

  fallbackSend(url) {
    // Fallback for older browsers without navigator.sendBeacon support
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = url;
  }
}

// Usage example
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const analytics = new AnalyticsSDK('your-product-id');
  analytics.trackPageView();
});
```

This code example outlines the basic structure and functionality of an analytics SDK. It demonstrates how to send data to an analytics server using either the Beacon API or an image tag as a fallback, how to track performance metrics, handle errors, and record custom events. Remember, this is a starting point, and the implementation can be extended with more features like batched sending for performance optimization, more sophisticated error handling, or integration with popular frameworks.

**Conclusion**

When designing a front-end analytics SDK, the key considerations should include the types of data you wish to collect, how to efficiently and securely transmit this data to the server, and ensuring that your tracking does not adversely affect the user experience. Tailor your SDK to be flexible, extensible, and easy to integrate into existing projects.

## When to Use SPA and When to Use MPA?

### SPA: Single Page Application
Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. SPAs use JavaScript to load content and typically involve frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular. These frameworks can be configured as SPAs or MPAs, but are often used to create efficient SPAs due to their component-based architectures.

**Use Cases for SPA:**
- **Complex Web Applications:** SPAs are ideal for situations where the user experience benefits from a seamless interaction without the page reloads typical of traditional web applications. Examples include advanced project management tools, interactive social media platforms, and rich user dashboards.
- **High Interaction Applications:** Applications that require real-time user interactions without interruption, such as live data updates, instant messaging platforms, and collaborative tools.
- **Internal Business Applications:** Large scale enterprise dashboards, such as CRM systems or cloud service consoles, where constant page reloading can hinder productivity.

**Advantages:**
- **Speed and User Experience:** After the initial load, SPAs do not require page reloads, which can significantly enhance the user experience by providing faster transitions and a smooth, app-like feel.
- **Reduced Server Load:** Since most resources are loaded once at the start, SPAs can reduce server load during the session.

**Considerations:**
- **Initial Load Time:** SPAs typically require more time to load initially as they fetch all the necessary JavaScript at once.
- **SEO Challenges:** Search engines traditionally have difficulties indexing content that is dynamically loaded by JavaScript. This can be mitigated by implementing Server Side Rendering (SSR) or using tools like prerendering.

### MPA: Multi Page Application
Multi Page Applications (MPAs) work in a traditional way where each change or submission leads to a new page being sent to the client by the server. This approach is straightforward and aligns with the original working of the web.

**Use Cases for MPA:**
- **Simple Websites:** If the site is mostly static and informational, such as a corporate website, an MPA may be more appropriate.
- **E-commerce Sites:** Online stores often benefit from an MPA setup, where each product page can be indexed separately by search engines.
- **Content-driven Projects:** News sites, blogs, and marketing websites where SEO is crucial can benefit from the straightforward link structure and easier indexability of MPAs.

**Advantages:**
- **SEO:** MPAs have a clear advantage in search engine optimization since each page is indexed separately with its own URL.
- **Simplicity:** Development can be more straightforward, as the server handles most of the content rendering.

**Considerations:**
- **User Experience:** Navigating between pages can result in a slower, less seamless user experience, particularly if the server response time is slow.
- **Higher Server Load:** Each page request loads resources from the server, which can increase load and affect performance during high traffic periods.

### Choosing Between SPA and MPA
The decision to use an SPA or MPA should not solely be based on technological capabilities but should consider the specific business needs and user experience requirements. Evaluate the complexity of the application, the need for speed and seamless interactions against the importance of SEO, and simplicity in development and maintenance.

## Design a Data Model and Core Features for an HTML5 Low-Code Development Platform

Creating an effective data model for a low-code development platform involves constructing a robust structure that supports extensive customization, real-time collaboration, and project management. This section outlines the primary components and functionalities that should be considered in the design process.

- **User Interface Design Tools:** Tools should allow users to visually create and adjust UI components. Features might include drag-and-drop interfaces, property inspectors, and responsive design options.
- **Project Management:** Capabilities should include creating new projects, saving ongoing work, publishing finished or interim stages, and managing project versions.
- **Collaboration Features:** The platform should support simultaneous editing by multiple users, conflict resolution strategies, and live updates to facilitate team-based project development.
- **Extensibility:** The system should allow for the integration of third-party or custom-built plugins and components to enhance functionality.

### Data Model Considerations

To achieve efficient and scalable management of project data and user activities, consider the following:

- **Data Syncing:** Use technologies such as WebSockets for real-time communication and long polling for less frequent updates to ensure that all users see the most current project state without significant delay.
- **Component Selection:** Maintain a detailed registry of each user-selected component, identified by unique IDs. This registry should track changes to component properties over time, aiding in undo/redo features and historical edits.
- **Layer Management:** Implement a system to manage the z-index and stacking of UI components through an organized list or array. This arrangement helps in manipulating layer properties like order, visibility, and nesting.

### Efficient Component Management

Organizing components and their properties efficiently ensures smoother operation and better performance:

- **Style Management:** Centralize styling information within a `style` object for each component to facilitate the application of themes and visual updates.
- **Layer Representation:** Utilize array indices for managing layer depth to simplify rendering logic and enable quick adjustments to the visual hierarchy.

### Example Implementation in React

Below is an example of a React context provider setup for managing project state in a low-code development environment:

```jsx
import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';

const ProjectContext = React.createContext();

const ProjectProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [project, setProject] = useState({
        title: "My New Project",
        settings: {
            language: 'EN',
            theme: 'light',
        },
        layout: {
            backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
            fontSize: '14px',
        },
        components: [
            {
                id: 'header',
                name: 'Main Header',
                type: 'text',
                style: {
                    color: '#333',
                    fontSize: '32px',
                },
                attributes: {
                    content: 'Welcome to Your Project',
                },
                children: [],
            },
            {
                id: 'image1',
                name: 'Feature Image',
                type: 'image',
                style: {
                    width: '100%',
                    height: 'auto',
                },
                attributes: {
                    src: 'url/to/your/image.jpg',
                    alt: 'Descriptive Image Alt Text',
                },
            }
        ],
        selectedComponentId: null,
    });

    const handleComponentSelect = (componentId) => {
        setProject(prevProject => ({ ...prevProject, selectedComponentId: componentId }));
    };

    return (
        <ProjectContext.Provider value={{ project, setProject, handleComponentSelect }}>
            {children}
        </ProjectContext.Provider>
    );
};

const App = () => {
    const { project, handleComponentSelect } = useContext(ProjectContext);

    const renderComponent = (component) => (
        <div style={component.style} onClick={() => handleComponentSelect(component.id)}>
            {component.type === 'text' ? component.attributes.content : (
                <img src={component.attributes.src} alt={component.attributes.alt} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
            )}
        </div>
    );

    return (
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: project.layout.backgroundColor }}>
            <h1 style={{ fontSize: project.layout.fontSize }}>{project.title}</h1>
            {project.components.map(renderComponent)}
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Design a "User - Role - Permission" System

Implementing a User - Role - Permission system effectively manages access within software, such as a blog management system. This is typically structured using the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, a proven approach for handling large-scale permission management due to its scalability and maintainability.

RBAC helps simplify the assignment and management of access rights within a system by linking permissions to roles, and roles to users. This model is adaptable, making it easier to implement changes to access policies and manage user permissions with minimal disruption.

### User Types and Permissions

A blog management system may feature several types of users, each with unique permissions:

- **Normal User**: Capable of reading, auditing, and hiding blog posts.
- **Admin User**: Inherits all permissions of a normal user, and can additionally update and delete blog posts.
- **Super Admin**: Inherits all permissions of an admin user, with further capabilities to manage user accounts, assign roles, and modify user roles and permissions.

### Data Models

Key entities in the RBAC system include:

#### User
- `id`: A unique identifier for each user.
- `user_name`: A username for logging in.
- `hashed_password`: A securely encrypted password.
- `comment`: An optional field for notes or additional information about the user.

#### Role
- `id`: A unique identifier for each role.
- `role_name`: The name of the role, indicative of its associated permissions.

#### Permission
- `permission_id`: A unique identifier for each permission.
- `permission_name`: A description of the action that the permission allows.

### Relationships

Effective management of relationships is crucial in an RBAC system to maintain data integrity and system security.

#### User_Role
- `user_id`: Connects to a specific user.
- `role_id[]`: An array of role identifiers, enabling a many-to-many relationship between users and roles.

#### Role_Permission
- `role_id`: Connects to a specific role.
- `permission_id[]`: An array of permission identifiers, allowing a role to be associated with multiple permissions.

### Functional Modules

The system should be divided into manageable modules to enhance maintainability and scalability:

- **User Management**: Handles creating, deleting, modifying users, and assigning roles.
- **Role Management**: Manages creating, deleting, and modifying roles, as well as assigning permissions.
- **Permission Management**: Responsible for creating, deleting, and modifying permissions.

### Design Principles

- **Clarity**: Components should be distinct and understandable to both developers and end-users.
- **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to modify and update.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate growth in users, roles, and permissions without degradation in performance.
- **Standards Adherence**: Follow established best practices and standards, utilizing existing solutions before developing new methodologies.

## Design a HTML5 prize draw page, what are the backend api you need to implement?
Thinking process:  
1. think about the user flow, business logic process, different stages of the process
2. think about the api you need to implement in each step

### User Flow and Business Logic

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: This is the starting point for user interaction on the prize draw page. Users need to log in or register to participate.
2. **Prize Draw Participation**: The system checks if the user has already participated in the draw. If not, the user can proceed to draw a prize.
3. **Result Handling and Information Submission**: After drawing, the user can see the results and must submit additional information (e.g., shipping address) if they win.
4. **Post-Draw Interactions**: Users can check the status of their prize, view previous draws, and get details about the prizes they've won.

### Backend API Requirements

To support the user flow and business logic detailed above, a robust set of backend APIs will need to be developed:

1. **User API**: Register a new user. Authenticate a user. Retrieve user profile information. Update user profile information.

2. **Draw Prize API**: Perform a prize draw. Retrieve the current status of a draw. Fetch the result of the last prize draw.

3. **Prize API**: List all available prizes. Get details about a specific prize. Retrieve the user's prize draw history. Update information about a prize (admin restricted).

4. **Statistics API**: Obtain general statistics about page visits, user participation in draws, and shares.

5. **Share API**: Log a user's action of sharing the page to social media.

## How would you approach technology selection as the front-end lead on a project?

Choosing the right technology stack is essential for the success of a project. This decision should be guided by several factors, which include but are not limited to the project requirements, the team's expertise, and the long-term maintenance of the project.

1. Choosing a Front-End Framework

    Frameworks like Vue, React, Nuxt.js, and Next.js each have their strengths and are suitable for different kinds of projects:

    - **Vue and Nuxt.js**: Best for progressive web applications and when you need a quick development environment setup. Vue's ecosystem is friendly and incrementally adoptable.
    - **React and Next.js**: Ideal for large-scale applications with complex states and dynamic content. React's component-based architecture facilitates reusable UI components.
2. Selecting the Programming Language
   - **JavaScript**: The standard language of the web; vast ecosystem, high flexibility.
   - **TypeScript**: Offers type safety and is preferable in large projects to reduce bugs and enhance code quality.
3. DevOps, CI/CD, and Build Tools
   - Incorporating DevOps practices and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines ensures that your development process is efficient and that deployments are smooth.
   - Common build tools like Webpack and Babel are essential for bundling JavaScript applications and managing assets.

### Decision Factors
- Is the community mature?  
    A mature community means better support, more libraries, and a greater likelihood of finding solutions to problems that arise.
- Does our company have experience with the technology?
    Leveraging existing knowledge can reduce training time and lead to faster development cycles.
-Cost of learning for the team
    Consider how easy it is for your team to learn the technology. Avoid high learning curves if speed is a priority.

### Cost Considerations
-Learning Curve
    Technologies that are complex to understand or that have poor documentation can slow down development.
- Maintenance
    For instance, excessive use of `any` in TypeScript can defeat the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place due to the lack of type safety.
- DevOps Costs
    The integration of continuous integration and continuous delivery systems can vary in complexity and cost depending on the chosen technologies.

**Final Note**: While there's no inherently "good" or "bad" technology, the best choice always depends on the specific context of the project and the composition of the team. It's important not to follow trends blindly but to choose technologies that offer the best balance of benefits to challenges in your specific situation. Always be balanced and analytical in your approach to technology selection.

## Implement HTML5 Image Lazy Loading

1. **HTML Markup Setup**: Implement the `loading` attribute in the `<img>` tag to utilize browser-native lazy loading. For older browser compatibility, use `data-src` for the image URL and `src` for a placeholder.

    ```html
    <img src="placeholder.png" data-src="actual_image.png" alt="Descriptive Text" loading="lazy">
    ```

2. **Scroll Event Handling**: Monitor the scroll event to load images as they come into view. Throttle the event to enhance performance by reducing the frequency of execution.

    ```javascript
    window.addEventListener('scroll', _.throttle(() => {
        document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]').forEach(img => {
            if (img.getBoundingClientRect().top < window.innerHeight) {
                img.src = img.dataset.src;
                img.removeAttribute('data-src'); // Prevent reprocessing
            }
        });
    }, 100));
    ```

3. **Initial Image Processing**: On page load, assess and load visible images immediately, catering for content initially within the viewport.

    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        mapImagesAndTryLoad(); // Load visible images at start
    });
    ```

**Optimization Tips**

- **Intersection Observer API**: Use this modern API for a more efficient detection of visible elements, which avoids the overhead of repeated event handling.
- **Throttle vs. Debounce**: Choose between these techniques based on event characteristics and desired responsiveness. Throttling ensures regular execution at fixed intervals, suitable for scroll events, while debouncing delays execution until event activity stops, ideal for resize events.

1. Get Image Position and Window Height
    - Understanding an element's position and the viewport size is essential for tasks like animations, dynamic content loading, and responsive design.
2. Retrieve Element Position
   - **Using `getBoundingClientRect()`**: This method returns an object detailing an element's size and its position relative to the viewport.
       ```javascript
       const elementPosition = document.getElementById('example').getBoundingClientRect();
       ```
3. Determine Viewport Size
   - **Using `window.innerHeight`**: This property gives the height of the layout viewport, useful for sizing and layout adjustments.
       ```javascript
       const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;
       ```

### Practical Example
```html
<body>
    <!-- Images tagged for lazy loading -->
    <img src="placeholder.png" data-src="actual_image.png" alt="Image Description" loading="lazy">
    <img src="placeholder.png" data-src="actual_image.png" alt="Image Description" loading="lazy">
</body>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.11/lodash.min.js"></script>
<script>
    // Throttled scroll event for lazy loading
    window.addEventListener('scroll', _.throttle(() => {
        mapImagesAndTryLoad();
    }, 100));

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        mapImagesAndTryLoad(); // Immediately load visible images
    });
</script>
```
