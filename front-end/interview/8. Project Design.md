## Designing a Front-End Analytics SDK

A Front-End Analytics Software Development Kit (SDK) is essential for collecting, analyzing, and reporting user behavior data on websites. This includes data such as page views (PV), click events, custom events (e.g., subscriptions to a VIP service, cancellations of a VIP service), performance metrics, and error logging. Large companies often develop their own analytics solutions, while small to medium-sized enterprises might opt for third-party services like Google Analytics.

The SDK serves as a bridge between the client-side environment and the analytics server, enabling a cyclical process: The SDK collects data from the user's interactions with the website, sends this data to the analytics server, and then the server processes and analyzes the data to generate reports. These insights can then be used to optimize the website, creating a feedback loop that enhances user experience.

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Page Views (PV):** Measure the number of times a page is loaded or reloaded in a browser.
2. **Custom Events:** Track specific user actions such as becoming a VIP member or cancelling a VIP membership.
3. **Performance Metrics:** Monitor the performance of the website, including loading times and interaction delays.
4. **Error Logging:** Capture JavaScript errors and promise rejections to identify issues affecting user experience.

### SDK Design Overview

```javascript
class AnalyticsSDK {
  constructor(productId) {
    this.productId = productId;
    this.initPerformanceTracking();
    this.initErrorTracking();
  }

  // Use private methods for internal functionality in TypeScript
  send(url, params = {}) {
    params.productId = this.productId;
    const queryString = Object.entries(params)
      .map(([key, value]) => `${encodeURIComponent(key)}=${encodeURIComponent(value)}`)
      .join('&');
    const fullUrl = `${url}?${queryString}`;
    // Use a beacon or an image to send data to overcome CORS issues, no need for response handling, and better compatibility
    navigator.sendBeacon ? navigator.sendBeacon(fullUrl) : this.fallbackSend(fullUrl);
  }

  initPerformanceTracking() {
    window.addEventListener('load', () => {
      const performanceData = performance.timing.toJSON ? performance.timing.toJSON() : performance.timing;
      this.send('https://analytics.example.com/performance', { data: JSON.stringify(performanceData) });
    });
  }

  initErrorTracking() {
    window.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
      this.sendError(event.message, event.filename, event.lineno, event.colno);
    });
    window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', (event) => {
      this.sendError('Unhandled Promise Rejection', event.reason);
    });
  }

  sendError(message, source = '', lineno = 0, colno = 0) {
    this.send('https://analytics.example.com/error', { message, source, lineno, colno });
  }

  trackPageView() {
    // Implement logic to avoid duplicate tracking on single-page applications
    this.send('https://analytics.example.com/pv', { url: window.location.href });
  }

  trackEvent(eventName, value) {
    this.send('https://analytics.example.com/event', { eventName, value });
  }

  fallbackSend(url) {
    // Fallback for older browsers without navigator.sendBeacon support
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = url;
  }
}

// Usage example
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const analytics = new AnalyticsSDK('your-product-id');
  analytics.trackPageView();
});
```

This code example outlines the basic structure and functionality of an analytics SDK. It demonstrates how to send data to an analytics server using either the Beacon API or an image tag as a fallback, how to track performance metrics, handle errors, and record custom events. Remember, this is a starting point, and the implementation can be extended with more features like batched sending for performance optimization, more sophisticated error handling, or integration with popular frameworks.

**Conclusion**

When designing a front-end analytics SDK, the key considerations should include the types of data you wish to collect, how to efficiently and securely transmit this data to the server, and ensuring that your tracking does not adversely affect the user experience. Tailor your SDK to be flexible, extensible, and easy to integrate into existing projects.
