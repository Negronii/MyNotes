## Why 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3
This is a result of how computers handle binary floating-point arithmetic.

When you add these approximations, the tiny errors in their representation lead to results that are not exact, hence 0.1 + 0.2 results in something slightly different from 0.3. 

In practical terms, to compare floating-point numbers in such cases, a common approach is to check if they are close enough to each other, within a small tolerance, rather than expecting exact equality.

```javascript
const tolerance = 0.0001;
const sum = 0.1 + 0.2;
const target = 0.3;

if (Math.abs(sum - target) < tolerance) {
    console.log('Equal');
} else {
    console.log('Not Equal');
}
```

## Front-End Storage Options

Understanding the different storage options available in front-end development is crucial for managing data efficiently and enhancing user experience. Each storage mechanism has its unique features, capacity, and use cases. Here, we'll explore three primary storage spaces: `LocalStorage`, `SessionStorage`, and `Cookies`, focusing on their characteristics, benefits, and practical applications.

### LocalStorage

LocalStorage provides a way to store data persistently on the client's browser. It's a key-value storage mechanism that allows data to remain saved across browser sessions and even after the browser is closed and reopened.

**Features:**

- **Persistent Storage:** Data remains until it's explicitly removed via script or by the user, making it reliable for long-term data storage.
- **Capacity:** Offers around 5MB of storage per domain, which is sufficient for most use cases without impacting performance.
- **Access:** Data is accessible synchronously, ensuring easy retrieval from the same domain without involving server requests.

**Uses:**

- Ideal for saving user preferences, themes, or other settings that enhance the user experience.
- Caching application data to speed up load times and reduce dependency on network requests.
- Storing game progress or application states that can be resumed later.

### SessionStorage

SessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage in many ways but is designed for storage that lasts only for the duration of the page session. It's perfect for data that doesn't need to persist beyond the current tab or window.

**Features:**

- **Tab-Specific Storage:** Unique storage space for each tab or window, cleared automatically when the tab or window is closed.
- **Capacity:** Also offers about 5MB of storage per domain, aligning with LocalStorage.
- **Access:** Allows for synchronous access within the same domain, facilitating quick data retrieval for the session's duration.

**Uses:**

- Suitable for storing data related to user input, form states, or selections within a single session, preventing data loss when navigating pages.
- Temporary storage of application states that should not be retained after the session ends.
- Facilitating state management in single-page applications (SPAs) for a seamless user experience without persisting data beyond necessity.

### Cookies

Cookies are fundamentally different from LocalStorage and SessionStorage in that they are intended to be sent to and from the server with each HTTP request. This makes them a powerful tool for session management and tracking user activity.

**Features:**

- **Server Communication:** Automatically included with every HTTP request, making them ideal for authentication and state management.
- **Capacity:** Limited to about 4KB per cookie, which constrains their use to smaller data sets.
- **Expiration:** Can be set with a specific expiration date, after which they're deleted automatically, supporting both session-based and persistent storage strategies.

**Uses:**

- Managing user sessions by storing session identifiers, enabling users to remain logged in between visits.
- Storing user preferences or settings that influence server-side rendering or content delivery.
- Implementing tracking mechanisms for analytics, user behavior analysis, or targeted advertising.

### Choosing the Right Storage Mechanism

- **LocalStorage** shines for storing larger amounts of data that need to persist over long periods, without the overhead of server communication. It's best for enhancing client-side experience with minimal impact on performance.
- **SessionStorage** offers a transient storage solution for sensitive or temporary data, ensuring that information is not retained beyond the necessary scope of the user's session.
- **Cookies** remain a staple for scenarios requiring server-side access to client data, especially for authentication, session management, and personalization efforts. Their small size and automatic transmission with HTTP requests make them indispensable for certain tasks, albeit with considerations for security and performance.

## Explain how the stack is used in memory management for frontend applications
It operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, efficiently managing function calls and primitive data types. When a function is invoked, its variables are pushed onto the stack, and upon the function's completion, they are removed. This system is particularly suitable for handling temporary, short-lived data. However, the stack's limited size means excessive usage can result in a stack overflow error.

## Explain how the heap is used in memory management for frontend web applications
It's used for dynamic allocation, primarily for objects and complex data structures. Unlike the stack, the heap is a larger, unstructured memory pool that requires manual management. Memory allocation and deallocation in the heap are handled by the JavaScript engine, which includes tasks like object creation and garbage collection.

## Explain the difference between primitive types and reference types
In JavaScript, primitive types and reference types are stored and accessed differently, which affects how they are used in programming.

Primitive types, such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `bigint`, are stored directly in the variable's memory location, usually on the stack. This direct storage enables quick access and efficient memory management, particularly for simple, immutable values.

In contrast, reference types, like `object`, `array`, and `function`, are stored in the heap. When you create a reference type, the JavaScript engine allocates memory in the heap and stores the data there. The variable on the stack then holds a reference (or pointer) to that memory location. This means when you manipulate an object or an array, you're working through a reference. Any changes made to the object or array are reflected across all references to that object, as they all point to the same memory location in the heap.

### Related Topic: Memory Allocation for Objects and Arrays
Understanding how JavaScript allocates memory for objects and arrays is crucial. Since these are reference types, any operation involving copying or passing them around in your code means you're handling references, not the actual data. This behavior can lead to unexpected mutations if not properly managed, and is a fundamental concept in understanding JavaScript's memory management and behavior.

## Garbage Collection in JavaScript

Garbage collection in JavaScript is an automated process that identifies and frees up memory that is no longer being used by the application. This process is vital for preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory usage. JavaScript implements garbage collection primarily through the following methods:

1. **Reference Counting**: In this method, the garbage collector counts the number of references to a value. When the reference count drops to zero, indicating that no part of the program is using that value, it is considered garbage and eligible for collection. However, reference counting has a significant limitation with circular references, where two objects reference each other, leading to memory leaks as their reference count never reaches zero.

2. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**: Modern JavaScript engines, such as V8 (Chrome, Node.js) and SpiderMonkey (Firefox), use the Mark-and-Sweep algorithm. This method involves marking "roots" (variables directly referenced by the code being run, plus global variables). The garbage collector then traverses from these roots and marks all reachable objects. Objects not marked as reachable are considered unreachable and eligible for garbage collection. This approach effectively resolves the issue of circular references found in reference counting.

## Closures and Memory Leaks in JavaScript

Closures in JavaScript are not inherent sources of memory leaks. They are essential features that allow functions to access and remember variables from their lexical scope, even after the outer function has executed. However, if closures retain references to extensive scopes or objects longer than needed, they can contribute to memory leaks. This typically occurs when a closure, no longer in use, is still referenced in the code, preventing the garbage collector from freeing the memory of the scope's variables. Developers can prevent such issues by carefully managing the lifecycle of closures and ensuring they are dereferenced when no longer needed. This is particularly important in scenarios with loops or large objects.

## Detecting Memory Leaks in JavaScript and React

To detect memory leaks in JavaScript and React, tools like the Chrome Developer Tools are invaluable. The Performance tab in these tools allows developers to record memory usage while interacting with the application. Observing the heap usage over time helps identify potential memory leaks, indicated by a continuous increase in memory usage without drops after garbage collection cycles. 

Common scenarios leading to memory leaks in React include:
- Unmanaged event listeners
- Uncleared timers
- Misuse of external libraries
- Improper handling of state and props

Preventing memory leaks involves proactive resource management, such as removing event listeners and clearing timers when components unmount.

## WeakMap and WeakSet in JavaScript
WeakMap and WeakSet in JavaScript are collections that store objects weakly, meaning their elements are not prevented from being garbage-collected. They are often used in managing caches, tracking object references, and keeping metadata about objects without affecting their lifecycle.

- **WeakMap**: Allows associating data with objects without preventing their garbage collection. This is useful for private data or caches that do not interfere with the lifecycle of the objects. Ideal for situations where you want to avoid creating memory leaks by inadvertently retaining references to objects.

- **WeakSet**: Enables tracking a group of objects for presence checks without affecting their garbage collection. This is useful for tracking which objects have undergone a specific process without creating memory leaks.

## Describe the Complete Process of Entering a URL to Presenting the Page

When a URL is entered into a browser, the process from initiating a web request to the final rendering of the page involves several critical steps. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Web Request
1. **DNS Lookup**: The browser initiates a DNS query to convert the hostname in the URL into an IP address. This process may involve querying multiple DNS servers.
2. **TCP Connection**: Establishes a TCP connection with the server using a three-way handshake. This ensures a reliable communication channel.
3. **HTTP Request**: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address, requesting the webpage content.
4. **Server Response**: The server processes the request and sends back a response, typically including the HTML source code of the page.

### Parsing HTML
1. **Resource Fetching**: As the browser parses the HTML, it may encounter references to external resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and videos. Each of these resources may require additional DNS lookups, TCP connections, and HTTP requests.
2. **DOM and CSSOM Trees**: The browser converts the HTML document into a structured format known as the Document Object Model (DOM). Simultaneously, CSS files are processed into the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) or style tree.
3. **Render Tree Construction**: The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the render tree, which represents all visible elements on the page and their styles.
4. **Optimization**: To optimize loading and parsing:
   - CSS is typically placed in the `<head>` to avoid rendering blocks.
   - JavaScript files are placed at the end of the `<body>` or loaded with `defer` or `async` attributes to not block HTML parsing.
   - Specifying image dimensions helps in layout calculation and prevents reflows.

### Rendering the Page
1. **Layout Calculation**: The browser calculates the size and position of each element in the render tree.
2. **Painting**: The visible elements are then painted onto the screen.
3. **JavaScript Execution**: JavaScript files are executed, which may modify the DOM and trigger a re-rendering of the page.
4. **Asynchronous Loading**: Some resources, like CSS and images, are fetched asynchronously and may cause the page to render again upon loading.

### Repaint vs. Reflow

Understanding the difference between repaint and reflow is crucial in web development, especially for dynamic web pages where elements can change frequently due to animations, modals, dialogs, popups, or modifications to the DOM like adding or deleting elements.

#### Repaint
A repaint occurs when changes are made to an element's visual appearance that do not affect its layout in the document. Examples include changes in color, background-color, visibility, and outline. During a repaint, the element's geometry (size and position) remains unchanged, and thus, it does not impact the position of any other elements.

#### Reflow
Reflow, also known as layout, involves recalculating the positions and sizes of elements in the document. This process is more computationally expensive than repaints because it affects the layout of the element that is changing and may also impact other elements on the page. Causes of reflow include changes to the browser window size, alterations in content (such as adding or removing elements), and modifications to elements' styles affecting their sizes (e.g., width, height, margin, padding).

#### Difference
The primary difference between repaint and reflow is the scope of impact and the cost in terms of performance. Reflows can trigger repaints, but repaints do not necessarily cause reflows. Because reflows can impact the layout of the entire page, they are more performance-intensive than repaints.

#### Methods to Avoid Unnecessary Reflows
- **Batch Style Changes**: Apply multiple style changes at once by changing the class of an element instead of individual styles.
- **Minimize DOM Access**: Modify elements offscreen or in a document fragment before adding them to the DOM. Using `display: none` before making changes can remove the element from the flow, thus reducing reflow costs.
- **Use Block Formatting Context (BFC)**: Utilizing BFC properties can isolate elements from affecting each other, minimizing the need for reflows.
- **Event Optimization**: Use debouncing and throttling for events that trigger frequent reflows, such as window resizing or scrolling.
- **Optimize Animations**: Prefer CSS3 animations and `requestAnimationFrame` over JavaScript animations to reduce reflow and repaint costs.

### Expansion: Block Formatting Context (BFC)
A Block Formatting Context is an HTML box that serves as a containment boundary, ensuring that elements within it do not affect the layout of elements outside it. BFC can be triggered by:
- The root element (`html`).
- Elements with `float` properties other than `none`.
- Elements with `position: absolute` or `fixed`.
- Elements with `display: inline-block`, `table-cell`, `table-caption`, `flex`, `grid`, or other table-related values.
- Elements with `overflow` set to anything other than `visible`.

## What is the difference between `defer` and `async` attributes in `<script>` elements?

The `<script>` element can be used to include JavaScript in HTML documents. When scripts are loaded and executed, they can affect how quickly a page becomes interactive. The `defer` and `async` attributes provide different ways to control this behavior.

### `defer` for Deferred Execution
The `defer` attribute tells the browser to continue parsing the HTML document while the script is being downloaded asynchronously. The key point is that the script execution is deferred until the entire HTML document has been parsed. This means that scripts with `defer` will not run until the HTML parsing is complete, which is similar to placing a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` element. However, `defer` ensures that scripts are executed in the order they appear in the document, which is not guaranteed when scripts are manually placed at the bottom of the `<body>`. 

### `async` for Asynchronous Execution
The `async` attribute also allows the script to be downloaded in parallel to HTML parsing. However, unlike `defer`, `async` scripts are executed as soon as they are downloaded, which could be before or after the HTML parsing is complete. This means the execution order of scripts is not guaranteed. `async` is best used for scripts that do not depend on other scripts and do not modify the DOM (Document Object Model).

### If Neither `defer` nor `async` is Provided
If neither `defer` nor `async` is provided, the script is fetched and executed immediately, blocking the HTML parsing until the script is downloaded and executed. This can lead to slower page load times, especially for large scripts.

## Difference between HTMLCollection and NodeList

HTML and the Document Object Model (DOM) are essential components of web development. Understanding different parts of the DOM, such as `HTMLCollection` and `NodeList`, is crucial for manipulating web pages effectively.

- **HTMLCollection**: This is a live collection of HTML elements. It updates automatically when the DOM changes. `HTMLCollection` exclusively contains `Element` nodes, typically returned by methods like `document.getElementsByClassName` and the `.children` property of an element.

- **NodeList**: A more general collection that can include different types of nodes, not just elements. This can be live or static, depending on how it's obtained. For example, `NodeList` returned by `Node.childNodes` is live, but the one returned by `document.querySelectorAll` is static.

### Difference between HTMLCollection and NodeList

1. **Node Types**: `HTMLCollection` is limited to `Element` nodes, while `NodeList` can include any node types, such as `Element`, `Text`, and `Comment`.

2. **Dynamism**: `HTMLCollection` is always live, meaning it reflects DOM changes immediately. `NodeList` can be either live or static. Live `NodeList`s reflect DOM changes, whereas static ones do not.

### `.children` vs `.childNodes`

Considering the following HTML snippet:

```html
<p id='p1'>
    <em>hello</em> hello <b>bold</b><!-- comment -->
</p>
```

- `p.children` refers to an `HTMLCollection` containing only element nodes within `p` (`<em>` and `<b>` in this case). It does not include text nodes or comments.

- `p.childNodes` refers to a `NodeList` and includes all node types - `Element`, `Text`, and `Comment`. It will contain `<em>`, text nodes (including the 'hello' text), `<b>`, and the comment node.

- `p.tagName` and `p.nodeName` are properties used to get the tag name of an element. `p.tagName` is used specifically for elements and returns the tag name in uppercase, while `p.nodeName` is applicable to all types of nodes and returns the name of the node (the tag name for elements in uppercase).

In summary, `HTMLCollection` and `NodeList` are key concepts in DOM manipulation, each with its specific use cases. Understanding their differences is vital for efficient and effective front-end web development.

## Difference Between Browser and Node.js Event Loop:

JavaScript, known for its single-threaded nature, employs the event loop mechanism to manage asynchronous operations, facilitating non-blocking execution. This approach is pivotal in both browser and Node.js environments. However, the event loop's implementation and functionality exhibit distinct characteristics in each context, shaped by their unique operational demands.

### Micro-tasks and Macro-tasks:
- **Macro-tasks**: Encompass operations like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and various web API calls. They are scheduled to execute once the current script finishes and the micro-task queue is cleared.
- **Micro-tasks**: Primarily involve promise-related operations, including async/await. These tasks execute immediately after the current script, before any pending macro-tasks, granting them a higher execution priority.

### Browser Event Loop:
- In the browser, the event loop shares the main thread with activities such as DOM rendering, necessitating efficient task management to avoid UI disruptions.
- The browser event loop manages two kinds of task queues: macro-tasks and micro-tasks. Micro-tasks are given precedence, executing right after the current task, even before proceeding to the next macro-task. This prioritization ensures prompt handling of operations like promise resolutions, often before rendering the next frame.

### Node.js Event Loop:
- Node.js, while also single-threaded and dependent on asynchronous execution, classifies macro-tasks and micro-tasks into specific types and priorities. This reflects its backend-oriented nature, focusing on efficient I/O operations rather than UI concerns.
- **Macro-task types in Node.js**, listed in order of priority:
  - **Timers**: Includes `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for scheduling future tasks.
  - **I/O Callbacks**: Addresses network, stream, and TCP errors.
  - **Idle/Prepare**: Consists of internal Node.js engine tasks.
  - **Poll**: Responsible for fetching new I/O events.
  - **Check**: Manages `setImmediate` callbacks.
  - **Close Callbacks**: Executes callbacks such as `socket.on('close')`.

- **Micro-task types in Node.js**:
  - **`process.nextTick`**: This function defers the execution of a callback until the current operation concludes, offering very high priority.
  - **Promise/async/await**: Handles asynchronous operations using promises.

- In Node.js, the event loop initially executes synchronous code, then processes all micro-tasks (with `process.nextTick` having utmost priority), followed by macro-tasks. It also attends to micro-tasks as they emerge during macro-task execution.

The event loop in both browser and Node.js is fundamentally similar, enabling asynchronous JavaScript execution within a single-threaded context. However, their implementations diverge significantly. In Node.js, macro-tasks and micro-tasks are distinctly categorized with defined priorities, mirroring its backend emphasis on effective I/O management. Both environments prioritize synchronous tasks first, then micro-tasks, and finally macro-tasks. The browser's event loop, specifically designed to maintain UI responsiveness, prioritizes micro-tasks to ensure smooth user experiences. Conversely, Node.js's event loop structure is tailored for efficient I/O processing.



## Node.js Process Creation and Communication

### Process vs Thread
- **Process**: A process is the minimum unit for an Operating System (OS) to allocate resources and scheduling. It operates within its own independent memory space, ensuring that processes do not interfere with each other's operations.
- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of processing within a process. It shares the memory space of its parent process, allowing for efficient execution of concurrent operations within the same application. JavaScript, while operating on a single-threaded model, supports multithreading through mechanisms like Web Workers for web applications.

### Why Use Multiprocessing in JavaScript?
- **Utilization of Multi-core CPUs**: It allows applications to leverage multi-core CPU architectures, significantly improving computation speed and application responsiveness.
- **Memory Limitations**: Each Node.js process has a memory limit. Multiprocessing enables an application to surpass the memory limitations of a single process, utilizing more memory collectively across multiple processes.
- **Efficiency and Performance**: Multiprocessing can lead to better resource utilization, enhanced performance, and reduced execution times by distributing workload across multiple CPU cores.
- **Application Methods**: In the context of web applications, `WebWorker` is utilized for multiprocessing to offload tasks from the main thread. For server-side applications using Node.js, multiprocessing is achieved through the `fork` or `cluster` modules, facilitating concurrent execution of tasks and improved application scalability.

### Fork in Node.js
The `fork` method is a part of the `child_process` module in Node.js, designed to create child processes. Here is a example illustrating how to use `fork`:

```javascript
// Main process (e.g., server.js)
const http = require('http');
const { fork } = require('child_process');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    if (req.url === '/compute') {
        const computeProcess = fork('./compute.js');
        computeProcess.send('Start');

        computeProcess.on('message', (result) => {
            res.end(`Result: ${result}`);
        });

        computeProcess.on('exit', () => console.log('Computation process exited'));
    } else {
        res.end('Server is running');
    }
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 3000'));

// Child process (e.g., compute.js)
process.on('message', (msg) => {
    if (msg === 'Start') {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) sum += i;
        process.send(sum);
        process.exit(0);
    }
});
```

### Cluster in Node.js
The `cluster` module in Node.js enables the creation of child processes that share server ports, facilitating load balancing across multiple CPU cores. Below is a example of using `cluster`:

```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    console.log(`Master process is running with PID: ${process.pid}`);

    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
    }

    cluster.on('exit', (worker) => {
        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died. Restarting...`);
        cluster.fork();
    });
} else {
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Hello from Node.js!');
    }).listen(8000);

    console.log(`Worker started with PID: ${process.pid}`);
}
```

**Best Practices**:
- **PM2 for Process Management**: In production, consider using PM2 or similar tools for advanced process management and load balancing. These tools offer more sophisticated monitoring, logging, and clustering features.
- **Fork vs. Cluster Usage**:
  - **Fork**: Best suited for offloading CPU-intensive tasks to child processes, thereby preventing the main application thread from blocking.
  - **Cluster**: Ideal for creating redundant worker processes in server applications, enhancing availability and fault tolerance, especially under high load.

## Describe JS-bridge principles

### What is JS-bridge
JSBridge serves as a middleware between native applications and JavaScript running within a webview. JavaScript cannot directly invoke native APIs due to the sandboxed nature of web content for security reasons. A JSBridge provides a structured interface through which JavaScript can communicate with the native side of an application. This enables web content to access device features or native functionality that is otherwise inaccessible to pure web applications. For example, within the Facebook app, it's possible to open H5 websites; this is facilitated by JSBridge, allowing the web content to interact with the app's native features.

### Frequent used methods to achieve JS-Bridge

1. **Global API Registration**: This method involves exposing native functions as global JavaScript functions that can be called directly from the web content. However, this approach may encounter issues with asynchronous execution, such as delays in reading from local files or fetching data over the network. For example:

```js
// Incorrect: const version = window.getVersion() // getVersion is from bridge, but have problem of lag at async, e.g. read from local file or web
async function getVersion() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (window.bridge && window.bridge.getVersion) {
      resolve(window.bridge.getVersion());
    } else {
      reject('Bridge or getVersion method not found.');
    }
  });
}
```

2. **URL Scheme (Recommended)**: This technique involves defining custom URL schemes that the native application can recognize and handle. When a webview navigates to a URL with a custom scheme, the app intercepts the request and performs the corresponding native action. This method is more flexible and allows for easy asynchronous communication. A common implementation involves creating invisible iframes to trigger these URL schemes without navigating away from the current page. The example provided showcases an SDK object encapsulating calls to different native functions via URL schemes:

```js
// Example of an SDK object to interface with native app functions through URL schemes
const sdk = {
    invoke(url, data, onSuccess, onError) {
        const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
        iframe.style.visibility = 'hidden';
        document.body.appendChild(iframe);
        iframe.onload = () => {
            try {
                const content = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML;
                onSuccess(JSON.parse(content));
            } catch (error) {
                onError(error);
            } finally {
                iframe.remove();
            }
        };
        iframe.onerror = (error) => {
            onError(error);
            iframe.remove();
        };
        iframe.src = `my-app-name://${url}?data=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data))}`;
    },
    fn1(data, onSuccess, onError) {
        this.invoke('api/fn1', data, onSuccess, onError);
    },
    fn2(data, onSuccess, onError) {
        this.invoke('api/fn2', data, onSuccess, onError);
    },
    fn3(data, onSuccess, onError) {
        this.invoke('api/fn3', data, onSuccess, onError);
    }
};
```

## How are Hybrid Templates Updated?
### Template Management and Version Control
Effective template management is achieved through systematic version control and careful organization:

1. **CMS Upload:** Templates are uploaded to a template server via a content management system (CMS), ensuring that all digital assets are centrally managed.
2. **Version Tagging:** Each template upload is tagged with a unique version identifier (e.g., v1.0, v1.1). This practice supports effective iteration management, facilitates easy rollback in case of issues, and simplifies version comparisons.

### Template Integration in Applications
Templates are integrated into applications through a series of steps that ensure their proper utilization and rendering:

1. **Template Retrieval:** Applications fetch the latest template versions from the server as needed, downloading essential files including HTML, JavaScript (JS), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
2. **Webview Rendering:** The application's view layer utilizes a webview to render the downloaded content. Files are accessed through a URL scheme (e.g., `file://`), allowing for isolated and secure rendering within the app.
3. **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Webviews make AJAX calls to an API server to retrieve necessary data. This data is then dynamically populated into the HTML templates, creating a personalized user experience.

### Template Update Triggers
The timing of template updates is crucial to maintain both performance and user experience:

- **At Launch:** Each time the application is launched, it checks for and downloads any available new templates.
- **Periodic Updates:** Regular checks (e.g., every 5 minutes) are scheduled to ensure the application has the most current template, balancing the need for freshness with performance considerations.

### Managing Template Updates
The update process is designed to minimize disruption and maximize application performance:

1. **Performance Considerations:** Direct downloads of new templates at the time of detection can adversely affect the app’s responsiveness, particularly under poor network conditions.
2. **Background Processing:** To avoid performance hits, new templates are downloaded in the background, allowing the application to continue operating with the current version until the update is ready.
3. **Seamless Switch:** Upon successful download, the application seamlessly transitions to the new template version without interrupting the user experience, ensuring a smooth and imperceptible update process.

## How to Implement Multi-Tab Communication on a Website?

Implementing multi-tab communication in web applications allows for the sharing of data and messages between different tabs or windows of the same origin. Here are three common methods to achieve this, along with their advantages, limitations, and use cases.

### 1. Using WebSockets
WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, enabling real-time data exchange between the client and server.

- **Advantages**:
  - No CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) limitations, allowing for communication across different domains.
  - Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

- **Limitations**:
  - Requires server-side support, which can be more costly and complex to implement compared to client-side-only solutions.
  - Maintaining a WebSocket connection can be resource-intensive for both the server and client.

- **Use Case**:
  Ideal for applications that require real-time data exchange, such as live chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative editing tools.

### 2. Using `localStorage`
`localStorage` is a web storage API that allows data to be stored in key-value pairs in the browser, and it can be used for communication between tabs within the same origin.

- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement and does not require server-side support.
  - Works across tabs within the same origin, making it suitable for sharing data between different parts of the same application.

- **Limitations**:
  - Limited to communication within the same origin.
  - Storage space is limited (typically around 5MB).

- **Example Code**:
  ```html
  <!-- In one tab (e.g., list page) -->
  <script>
      window.addEventListener('storage', event => {
          if (event.key === 'changeInfo') {
              console.info('New info received:', event.newValue);
          }
      });
  </script>
  <!-- In another tab (e.g., detail page) -->
  <script>
      document.getElementById('btn1').addEventListener('click', () => {
          const newInfo = {
              id: 100,
              name: 'Item ' + Date.now()
          };
          localStorage.setItem('changeInfo', JSON.stringify(newInfo));
      });
  </script>
  ```
  - **Key Points**:
    - Tabs A and B are within the same origin.
    - Tab A sets `localStorage`, and Tab B listens for changes in `localStorage`.

### 3. Using `SharedWorker`
`SharedWorker` is a type of Web Worker that allows for the creation of a shared execution environment, accessible by multiple scripts even if they are in different windows, iframes, or tabs.

- **Advantages**:
  - Enables communication and data sharing between tabs, iframes, or windows from the same origin.
  - Offloads work to a background thread, preventing UI blocking.

- **Limitations**:
  - More complex to implement and test compared to other methods.
  - Support across browsers can be inconsistent.
  - Limited to same-origin communication.

- **Example Code**:
  ```html
  <!-- In one tab (e.g., list) -->
  <script>
      const worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
      worker.port.onmessage = e => console.info('Message from worker:', e.data);
  </script>
  <!-- In another tab (e.g., detail) -->
  <script>
      const worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
      document.getElementById('btn1').addEventListener('click', () => {
          worker.port.postMessage('Message from detail tab');
      });
  </script>
  ```
  ```js
  // worker.js
  const ports = new Set();
  onconnect = event => {
      const port = event.ports[0];
      ports.add(port);
      port.onmessage = e => {
          // Broadcast the message to all connected ports except the sender
          ports.forEach(p => {
              if (p !== port) {
                  p.postMessage(e.data);
              }
          });
      };
      port.postMessage('SharedWorker initialized');
  }
  ```
  - **Key Points**:
    - `SharedWorker` can start a shared process for communication between tabs from the same origin.
    - It is capable of running JavaScript in the background, independent of any particular tab, allowing for more complex inter-tab communication scenarios.

### How to Achieve Communication Between a Website and an Iframe

Communicating between a website and an iframe can be efficiently achieved using the `window.postMessage()` method. This approach allows for secure cross-origin communication without being restricted by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies. The `postMessage` method enables sending data from the parent page to an iframe or vice versa, regardless of their origin, ensuring a versatile and secure way to interact across different domains.

- **Advantages**:
  - Bypasses CORS restrictions, enabling communication across different origins.
  - Provides a mechanism to verify the origin of the messages, enhancing security.

- **Example Code**:

  - **Child (Iframe Content)**:
    ```html
    <!-- Child HTML content -->
    <p>Child page
      <button id="btn1">Send Message</button>
    </p>
    <script>
        const btn1 = document.getElementById('btn1');
        btn1.addEventListener('click', () => {
            console.info('Child button clicked');
            window.parent.postMessage('Message from child', '*'); // Use specific origin instead of '*' in production
        });

        window.addEventListener('message', event => {
            // Always check the origin of the data!
            if (/* validate event.origin */) {
                console.info('Origin:', event.origin);
                console.info('Child received:', event.data);
            }
        });
    </script>
    ```
  - **Parent**:
    ```html
    <!-- Parent HTML content -->
    <p>Index page
      <button id="btn1">Send Message</button>
    </p>
    <iframe id="iframe1" src="./child.html"></iframe>
    <script>
        const btn1 = document.getElementById('btn1');
        const iframe = document.getElementById('iframe1');

        btn1.addEventListener('click', () => {
            console.info('Parent button clicked');
            iframe.contentWindow.postMessage('Message from parent', '*'); // Use specific origin instead of '*' in production
        });

        window.addEventListener('message', event => {
            // Always validate the origin of the data!
            if (/* validate event.origin */) {
                console.info('Origin:', event.origin);
                console.info('Parent received:', event.data);
            }
        });
    </script>
    ```
- **Key Points**:
  - The `'*'` argument in `postMessage` indicates that the message can be sent to any origin. In production environments, this should be replaced with the specific target origin to prevent security vulnerabilities.
  - It's crucial to validate the `event.origin` in the message event listener to ensure that messages are only accepted from trusted sources. This validation prevents potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Handling Rendering of 100,000 Data Entries

It's essential to first communicate to the interviewer that returning 100,000 data entries in one go is technically impractical. A preferable approach would be to use **pagination** to limit the amount of data sent and rendered at any one time.

Before seeking solutions, assess whether the browser can handle processing 100,000 data entries. While handling such data as strings or simple data structures in JavaScript might be feasible, rendering them directly to the DOM would result in significant performance issues, including sluggishness and potential crashes.

### 1. **Custom Middleware Layer**:
Implement a custom Node.js middleware layer that fetches and processes the 100,000 data entries. The front-end application would then interact with this middleware instead of directly connecting to the backend server.

While this approach can help manage the data more efficiently by pre-processing it before rendering, it is costlier in terms of development time and resources.

### 2. **Virtual Scrolling (Virtual List)**:
Implement virtual scrolling to render only the DOM elements in the viewport. Elements outside the viewport are not rendered but are accounted for in terms of spacing to ensure smooth scrolling. As the user scrolls, elements enter the viewport are rendered, and those leaving the viewport are destroyed or reused.

Implementing virtual scrolling improves application performance significantly by reducing the number of DOM elements that need to be managed at any given time, thereby minimizing browser workload and memory usage.

This method is technically challenging to implement from scratch due to the need to manage the creation and destruction of DOM elements dynamically based on the scroll position. It is highly recommended to use third-party libraries that provide virtual scrolling capabilities.

For Vue.js projects, `Vue-virtual-scroll-list` can be used, and for React projects, `React-virtualized` is a suitable choice. These libraries simplify the implementation of virtual scrolling by handling the complexities of DOM element management based on scroll behavior.

However, even using these libraries, the performance is still a concern for phones and low-end devices. It's important to consider the user experience and the practicality of displaying such a large amount of data at once.



## How to Prevent 300ms Delay for Double Click to Zoom on Mobile Phones?
On mobile web applications, a common issue is the 300ms delay when users attempt to double-click (tap) to zoom. This delay was originally implemented to differentiate between a tap (single click) and a double-tap (double click). However, this can interfere with the responsiveness of web applications. In the past, developers used libraries like FastClick to circumvent this delay. Modern browsers have introduced ways to address this issue by detecting the site's responsiveness through meta tags.

To prevent the 300ms delay on mobile devices without relying on external libraries like FastClick, ensure your web application is using responsive design principles. Implement the following meta tag in your HTML:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
This meta tag informs the browser that your website is optimized for mobile devices, prompting it to disable the 300ms delay for a better user experience. This approach is preferred as it relies on standard responsive design practices rather than additional scripts, improving your website's performance and compatibility.
