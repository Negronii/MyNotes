### Difference Between Browser and Node.js Event Loop

JavaScript is designed to operate in a single-threaded manner, utilizing the event loop mechanism to manage asynchronous operations, which allows for non-blocking execution. 

#### Micro-tasks and Macro-tasks

- **Macro-tasks**: Include operations such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and various web API calls. These tasks are queued to run after the current script has completed execution and the micro-task queue has been cleared.
- **Micro-tasks**: Generally related to promise operations, including async/await. These tasks are executed immediately after the current script ends, prior to any pending macro-tasks, giving them a higher priority in execution.

#### Example Scenario

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout 1'), 0);

new Promise((resolve) => {
  console.log('Promise 1');
  resolve();
  console.log('Promise 1 then');
}).then(() => console.log('Promise 2'));

console.log('End');
```

**Output**:
```
Start
Promise 1
Promise 1 then
End
Promise 2
Timeout 1
```

Note that the Promise constructor is executed synchronously, while the `then` callback is queued as a micro-task, ensuring its execution before the `setTimeout` callback.

#### Browser Event Loop

- In the browser, the event loop operates on the main thread alongside activities such as DOM rendering, which requires careful task management to avoid UI disruptions.
- Task management in browsers involves two queues: macro-tasks and micro-tasks, with micro-tasks receiving higher priority. This arrangement ensures prompt processing of operations like promise resolutions, often before rendering the next frame.

#### Node.js Event Loop

- In contrast, Node.js organizes macro-tasks and micro-tasks into distinct types and priorities suitable for backend operations, focusing on efficient I/O handling rather than UI responsiveness.
- **Macro-task types in Node.js**, listed in order of priority:
  - **Timers**: Scheduling tasks like `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
  - **I/O Callbacks**: Managing errors related to network, streams, and TCP.
  - **Idle/Prepare**: Internal tasks of the Node.js engine.
  - **Poll**: Fetching new I/O events.
  - **Check**: Handling `setImmediate` callbacks.
  - **Close Callbacks**: Executing callbacks such as `socket.on('close')`.

- **Micro-task types in Node.js**:
  - **`process.nextTick`**: Allows deferring the execution of a callback until after the current operation, with a very high priority.
  - **Promise/async/await**: Manages asynchronous operations effectively.

- Node.js processes all micro-tasks (with `process.nextTick` as the highest priority) after the initial execution of synchronous code, followed by macro-tasks. During macro-task execution, it continues to process emerging micro-tasks.

The fundamental concept of the event loop is shared between the browser and Node.js, enabling asynchronous execution within a single-threaded context. However, their specific implementations reflect the different priorities and operational needs of the two environments: UI responsiveness in browsers and efficient I/O processing in Node.js.
