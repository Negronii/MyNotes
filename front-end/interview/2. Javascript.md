## JavaScript's Strict Mode Features

JavaScript's Strict Mode is a feature that enforces a stricter parsing and error handling mechanism on your JavaScript code. Activating Strict Mode can be done by adding `'use strict';` at the beginning of a script or a function block. This mode intentionally has different semantics from the normal code, aimed at improving code reliability and performance.

### Features of Strict Mode

1. **Mandatory Variable Declarations**: In Strict Mode, every variable must be declared before use. If a script attempts to use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will throw a `ReferenceError`. This requirement helps to avoid the accidental creation of global variables caused by typographical errors.

2. **Disallows the `with` Statement**: The `with` statement is not allowed in Strict Mode because it creates ambiguity about the scope of variables. Its use can lead to significant performance hits and complicates the debugging process, as it modifies the scope chain, making it harder to predict which variables will be affected by a piece of code.

3. **Scoped `eval()` Function**: Any declarations within an `eval()` expression in Strict Mode do not affect the surrounding scope, making `eval()` safer by preventing it from introducing new variables or modifying existing ones in the parent scope.

4. **Secure `this` Keyword Behavior**: In functions that are not called as methods of an object, the value of `this` is `undefined` in Strict Mode. This contrasts with non-strict mode, where `this` defaults to the global object, reducing the risk of inadvertently modifying the global environment.

5. **Prohibits Duplicate Parameter Names**: Functions cannot have multiple parameters with the same name, which eliminates potential errors from duplicated identifiers and enhances code clarity.

6. **Immutable Non-Writable Properties**: In Strict Mode, attempts to assign values to non-writable properties result in a `TypeError`. This feature ensures the immutability of constants and read-only properties, thus preserving data integrity.

7. **Restrictions on Deleting Properties**: Trying to delete non-deletable properties (such as built-in objects or fixed properties) will throw a `TypeError`, protecting important parts of the languageâ€™s core.

8. **No Octal Numeric Literals**: Octal literals and octal escape sequences are not allowed in Strict Mode. This restriction avoids confusion between mistakenly leading zeroes in numbers and octal syntax, making the code more readable and less prone to errors. 
   - Octal literals are those starting with a leading zero, like `010` stands for 8 in decimal. Octal escape sequences are those starting with `\`, like `\141` stands for `'a'`. We can use `u0061` instead of `\141` to represent `'a'`, and `0o10` instead of `010` to represent `8`.

### Conclusion

## Primitive Types
Primitive types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable and have a fixed memory allocation size. The primitive types in JavaScript are:

1. **`undefined`**:
   - Represents an undefined value.
   - Default value of uninitialized variables.
   - Should not be explicitly assigned to a variable.
   - Example: `let x; console.log(x); // undefined`

2. **`null`**:
   - Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
   - Often used to indicate a deliberate non-value.
   - `typeof null` returns `'object'`, which is a historical artifact in JavaScript.
   - Example: `let y = null; console.log(y); // null`

3. **`boolean`**:
   - Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` and `false`.
   - Type conversion to boolean:
     - Strings: Only an empty string (`''`) is `false`; all other strings are `true`.
     - Numbers: `0`, `-0`, `NaN`, `null`, `undefined`, and `false` are `false`; all other numbers are `true`.
     - Objects: Any object that is not `null` or `undefined` is `true` (e.g., `{}` is `true`).
   - Example: `let isTrue = true; let isFalse = false;`

4. **`number`**:
   - Represents numeric values, following the IEEE 754 standard.
   - Special values: `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (Not-a-Number).
   - `NaN` is unique: `NaN !== NaN`. Use `Number.isNaN()` to check for `NaN`.
   - Type conversion to number:
     - `Number('')` is `0`.
     - `Number('123')` is `123`.
     - `Number('abc')` is `NaN`.
     - `Number(true)` is `1`.
     - `Number(false)` is `0`.
     - `Number(null)` is `0`.
     - `Number(undefined)` is `NaN`.
     - `Number({})` is `NaN`.
   - Example: `let num = 42; let inf = 1/0; // Infinity`

5. **`string`**:
   - Represents a sequence of characters.
   - Immutable: once created, they cannot be changed.
   - Example: `let str = 'Hello, world!';`

6. **`symbol`** (added in ES6):
   - Represents a unique identifier.
   - Created using the `Symbol()` function.
   - Example: `let sym = Symbol('description');`
   - It is often used as an object property key to avoid name clashes, e.g. in function prototype method like .call, .apply, .bind.

7. **`bigint`** (added in ES11):
   - Represents whole numbers larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
   - Created by appending `n` to the end of an integer or using the `BigInt` function.
   - Example: `let big = 123456789012345678901234567890n;`
