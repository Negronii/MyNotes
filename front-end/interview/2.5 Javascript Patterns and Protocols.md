### Iterator Pattern
The iterator pattern is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that allows sequential access to the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying structure. This pattern is particularly useful in JavaScript, where it forms the basis of iterable objects that can be looped over with constructs like `for...of`.

#### Context in JavaScript

Introduced with ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), iterators in JavaScript are integral to handling collections of data, especially when the collection size is not predetermined or elements are generated dynamically. An iterator in JavaScript is an object that provides a `next()` method returning an object with properties:
- `value`: represents the next element in the sequence.
- `done`: a boolean indicating whether the sequence has been fully traversed.

#### Implementing an Iterator

Creating an iterable object in JavaScript involves defining a `Symbol.iterator` method, which returns an iterator. This method is automatically invoked by JavaScript's newer syntax features such as the `for...of` loop.

##### Example: Range Iterator

```javascript
// Define a range object that is iterable using the iterator pattern
const range = {
  start: 1,
  end: 5,

  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    let current = this.start;
    return {
      next: () => {
        if (current <= this.end) {
          return { value: current++, done: false };
        } else {
          return { done: true };
        }
      }
    };
  }
};

// Iterate over the range using a for...of loop
for (let num of range) {
  console.log(num);  // Outputs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

#### Usage in Modern JavaScript

Iterators are foundational to many built-in JavaScript structures such as:
- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Maps**
- **Sets**

These structures use iterators implicitly in language features like `for...of` loops, array destructuring, spread syntax, and others.

#### Advantages of Using Iterators

1. **Abstraction**: Provides a unified interface for element access, shielding clients from complex underlying data structures.
2. **Decoupling**: Separates data structures from the algorithms used on them, increasing modularity.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows algorithms to operate on diverse data structures simply by adhering to the iterator protocol.
