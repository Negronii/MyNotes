### What is the difference between `defer` and `async` attributes in `<script>` elements?

The `<script>` element can be used to include JavaScript in HTML documents. When scripts are loaded and executed, they can affect how quickly a page becomes interactive. The `defer` and `async` attributes provide different ways to control this behavior.

#### `defer` for Deferred Execution
The `defer` attribute tells the browser to continue parsing the HTML document while the script is being downloaded asynchronously. The key point is that the script execution is deferred until the entire HTML document has been parsed. This means that scripts with `defer` will not run until the HTML parsing is complete, which is similar to placing a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` element. However, `defer` ensures that scripts are executed in the order they appear in the document, which is not guaranteed when scripts are manually placed at the bottom of the `<body>`. 

#### `async` for Asynchronous Execution
The `async` attribute also allows the script to be downloaded in parallel to HTML parsing. However, unlike `defer`, `async` scripts are executed as soon as they are downloaded, which could be before or after the HTML parsing is complete. This means the execution order of scripts is not guaranteed. `async` is best used for scripts that do not depend on other scripts and do not modify the DOM (Document Object Model).

#### If Neither `defer` nor `async` is Provided
If neither `defer` nor `async` is provided, the script is fetched and executed immediately, blocking the HTML parsing until the script is downloaded and executed. This can lead to slower page load times, especially for large scripts.
