## How is a linked list used in front-end development?
In front-end development, linked lists aren't commonly used, but a notable example is in React's Fiber architecture. React Fiber uses a linked list to manage the component tree instead of a traditional tree structure. This shift allows React to perform work in chunks and prioritize updates more effectively. The linked list structure enables incremental rendering, where the rendering work can be paused and resumed, improving app performance and user experience. It also facilitates the handling of concurrent operations in the UI, allowing for smoother and more responsive interfaces. Overall, while linked lists are not a standard tool in front-end development, their use in React Fiber demonstrates how they can optimize rendering and state management in complex applications

## implementing a queue using a linked list in TypeScript:
In TypeScript, you can implement a queue using a linked list by maintaining references to both the head and tail of the list. The queue operations work as follows:

Enqueue (Add to Queue): To add an item, you create a new node and attach it to the current tail of the linked list, then update the tail reference to this new node. If the queue is empty, this new node is both the head and tail.

Dequeue (Remove from Queue): To remove an item, you take the value from the head of the linked list and then update the head reference to the next node in the list. If the list becomes empty, update the tail reference to null as well.

This approach ensures that both enqueue and dequeue operations are O(1), providing efficient queue management. It’s important to handle edge cases, such as dequeueing from an empty queue, to avoid errors.

## Implement a queue in TypeScript, and is a linked list faster or an array?
In TypeScript, implementing a queue can be done using either an array or a linked list. An array-based queue is simple to implement but its dequeue operation (shift) is O(n) due to the need to shift elements. In contrast, a linked list implementation offers O(1) time complexity for both enqueue and dequeue operations, as it allows for constant-time insertions and deletions without reindexing.

So, while both can be used to implement a queue, a linked list is generally faster and more efficient for typical queue operations. This makes linked lists preferable in scenarios where frequent enqueue and dequeue operations are expected, whereas arrays might be more suitable when memory efficiency is a priority and operations are less frequent.

## implement a queue with linkedlist
```ts
interface ILinkedListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ILinkedListNode | null;
}

class Queue {
    // undefined usually used for uninitialized value, null for empty values, here null is better
    private head: ILinkedListNode | null;
    private tail: ILinkedListNode | null;
    private len: number;

    // use constructor instead of set values above, make code more readable
    // Inside class methods, use this to refer to instance variables 
    constructor(){
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
        this.len = 0;
    }

    // for better clarity, mention return type void if return nothing
    offer(val: number): void {
        const temp: ILinkedListNode = {val: val, next: null};
        // in case the queue is empty, use === check value and type
        if (this.head === null) {
            this.head = temp;
            this.tail = temp;
        } 
        // normal case
        else {
            // avoid non-null assertions to avoid legitimate null/undefined errors, i.e. try avoid below commented code
            // this.tail!.next = temp;
            if (this.tail) {
                this.tail.next = temp;
            }
            this.tail = temp;
        }
        this.len += 1;
    }

    poll(): number | null {
        if (this.head === null) {
            return null;
        } 
        if (this.head.next === null) {
            this.tail = null;
        }
        // here use const instead of let, since it never changes
        const temp = this.head.val;
        this.head = this.head.next;
        this.len -= 1;
        return temp;
    }

    // with get keyword, we can use the return value as an attribute, e.g. const queue = new Queue(); const len = queue.size;
    get size(): number {
        return this.len;
    }
}
```

## Implement binary search and describe time complexity
```ts
// assume input nums is in ascending order, return the index or null if not found
function binarySearch(nums: number[], target: number): number | null {
    let left: number = 0;
    let right: number = nums.length - 1;
    // use <= for case length = 1
    while (left <= right) {
        // Use Math.floor to avoid floating point values for the mid index.
        let mid: number = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        }
        if (nums[mid] > target) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm divides the search interval in half with each step.

## Given an ascending number array and a number n, find 2 numbers in array sum is n. 
```ts
function twoSumsAscending(nums: number[], target: number): number[]{
    let left: number = 0;
    let right: number = nums.length - 1;
    // Use '<' instead of '<=' to prevent the same element from being used twice
    while (left < right) {
        if (nums[left] + nums[right] === target) {
            return [nums[left], nums[right]];
        }
        if (nums[left] + nums[right] < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return [];
}
```

## In-order, pre-order and post-order
In the context of binary trees, in-order, pre-order, and post-order refer to the three primary ways to traverse the nodes of the tree, each with a different order for visiting the nodes.
**In-Order Traversal**: Left, Root, Right.
**Pre-Order Traversal**: Root, Left, Right.
**Post-Order Traversal**: Left, Right, Root.

## find the kth smallest value in a binary search tree
```ts
interface ITreeNode{
    val: number;
    left: ITreeNode | null;
    right: ITreeNode | null;
}

function findKthSmallest(root:ITreeNode, k: number): number | null {
    let count: number = 0;
    let result: number | null = null;

    // this function is in-order
    function dfsHelper(curNode: ITreeNode) {
        if (curNode === null || result !== null) return;

        dfsHelper(curNode.left);

        if (++count === k) {
            result = curNode.val;
            return;
        }

        dfsHelper(curNode.right);
    }

    dfsHelper(root);

    return result;
}
```

## Why binary tree so important, not trinary or quanary tree? 
While arrays provide faster access (O(1)), adding or deleting elements is less efficient (O(N)). Linked lists offer efficient insertion and deletion (O(1)), but slower access times (O(N)).

Compared to arrays and linked lists, binary trees offer a good balance with O(logn) time complexity for access, add, and delete operations when the tree is balanced.

Binary trees, as opposed to ternary or quaternary trees, provide a simpler and more efficient structure for most applications. They strike a balance between maintaining low complexity and achieving efficient operations.

## Why balancing binary tree so important?
An unbalanced binary tree can degenerate into a linked list, leading to O(N) time complexity for operations like add, delete, update, and search. A balanced binary tree, on the other hand, maintains a height of O(logn), ensuring that operations can be performed in logarithmic time. This balance is essential for leveraging the efficiency of binary trees, especially in scenarios where quick search, insertion, and deletion are frequently required.

## Why tree operations has time complexity of O(logn)?
`logn` represents the height of a balanced binary tree. In a balanced tree, each operation like search, insert, or delete involves traversing a path from the root to a leaf node, or vice versa. The number of levels (or height) of the tree determines the maximum number of steps needed for these operations. Since a balanced binary tree is structured to have a height that grows logarithmically with the number of nodes (n), the operations are significantly more efficient than linear time complexity, particularly for large datasets.

## What is a black-red tree? What is B tree? 
- **Red-Black Tree**: It is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node in the tree is colored either red or black. The tree uses these colors along with specific rules to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. This balancing act ensures that the tree maintains its O(logn) time complexity for operations. Red-Black Trees are particularly valued for their relatively simple balancing logic and efficient operations, making them suitable for various applications, including implementing associative arrays and priority queues.

- **B-Tree**: A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. Unlike binary trees, B-Trees are multi-way trees (having more than two children) and are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, like databases and filesystems. They are designed to efficiently minimize disk I/O operations, and their branching factor (the number of child nodes) can be adjusted to optimize the balance between the tree's height and the number of nodes accessed per operation.

Both Red-Black Trees and B-Trees are advanced tree structures designed to optimize performance for different scenarios, with Red-Black Trees often used in memory and B-Trees in disk-based storage systems.

## Explain how the stack is used in memory management for frontend applications
The stack in frontend memory management is a structured region of memory that operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) basis. It's used primarily for storing primitive data types and pointers to objects during function calls. When a function is called, its variables are pushed onto the stack, and they are popped off when the function exits. The stack is fast and efficient for managing function calls due to its structured nature but is limited in size. Overuse can lead to a stack overflow error. It's ideal for temporary, short-lived data.

## How does the heap function in memory management for frontend web applications?
In frontend applications, the heap is a key area of memory used for dynamic allocation, especially for storing objects and complex data structures. It's a less organized memory pool compared to the stack and is managed manually. 

In terms of structure, the heap can be visualized as a complete binary tree, where each parent node is smaller (in a min-heap) or larger (in a max-heap) than its children. 

The logical structure of the heap is a binary tree, but physically, it is often implemented as an array. This array-based implementation maximizes space usage due to continuous memory allocation. In the array, the first index is often ignored for convenience, with the heap starting from the second index. For any given index `i` in this array, the parent node can be found at `Math.floor(i/2)`, while the left and right children are located at `2 * i` and `2 * i + 1`, respectively. This structure allows efficient operations like insertion and removal, which are crucial for managing dynamic data in web applications.

## Explain the difference between primitive types and reference types

In JavaScript, primitive types (like `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `bigint`) are stored directly in the location the variable accesses. They are stored in the stack, which provides quick access and efficient memory allocation. When you assign a primitive type to a variable, you're copying the value into that variable.

On the other hand, reference types (like `object`, `array`, and `function`) are stored in the heap, which is a larger pool of memory designed for storing larger, more complex data. Instead of storing the actual data in the variable on the stack, JavaScript stores a reference (or pointer) to the location in memory where the data is held. This means when you manipulate an object or an array, you're working with a reference to that data, not the actual data itself. Any changes made through one reference are seen by all other references because they all refer to the same underlying data in the heap.

## heap VS binary search tree
- searching is slower than BST, the left and right node is not ordered so we cannot use binary search
- add/search is faster, saves time in balancing in overal
- both time complexity is at O(logn) level, which is height of tree
