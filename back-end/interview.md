## Understanding Deadlocks
Deadlocks can occur in any system where shared resources are accessed concurrently. However, in the context of front-end development, this typically relates to asynchronous tasks and resource loading.

#### Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
To grasp how deadlocks occur and prevent them, it's essential to understand the following conditions, adapted from general computing to the web development context:

- **Mutual Exclusion**: A resource cannot be shared and is exclusively held by one process at a time. In web development, this could translate to exclusive access to the DOM or single-threaded operations in JavaScript where certain operations cannot run simultaneously due to browser limitations.

- **Hold and Wait**: A process is holding at least one resource and is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes. For example, a JavaScript event loop might be waiting for a fetch API response while holding onto DOM access until the fetch is completed.

- **No Preemption**: A resource can only be released voluntarily by the process holding it, not forcibly taken away. This is akin to JavaScript promises which cannot be canceled once initiated; they must resolve or reject.

- **Circular Wait**: There exists a set of processes, each of which is waiting for a resource held by another process in the set, creating a circular chain of dependencies. In the context of web applications, this might happen when multiple asynchronous JavaScript operations are waiting on each other to release some resource, like API data or access to IndexedDB.
